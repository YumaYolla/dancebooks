### Dedication

To teachers of merit, (particularly those at whose request the Danciad was composed, and who are most capable of deciding how far the author has done justice to the subject) he respectfully dedicates this work,

Academy of Dancing, 3, Kirby Street, Hatton Garden.

7th June 1824.

### Preface

The Danciad is founded on a dramatic prelude to the Author's 89th Public Ball, held the 30th October 1822 (when the characters were represented by himself and three of his pupils[[The performance of the original sketch, was, at the request of several subscribers, repeated at the author's vacation ball, 15th January 1824.]]) being intended as a descriptive sketch on the present state of ball-room dancing teachers and professors of dancing, academies, public balls, &c. &c.

The sketch being approved, was afterwards shown, in manuscript, to several eminent teachers, who strongly advised the author to continue the subject; as the various puffs and delusive advertisements of certain persons styling themselves "Professors of Dancing"[[This alludes more particularly to the London placard teachers, who almost invariably style themselves "Professors".]]: tended to bring even the art itself into disrepute, and loudly called for exposure and reprehension; however, what was every body's business was no-body's; though all continued to complain of injuries sustained in consequence of such practices, yet none attempted to draw on them the attention of the public[[Many strangers, forming their opinion from the delusive advertisements of certain teachers whose terms are very low, but never meant to be fulfilled, have objected to the charges of the respectable part of the profession, as exorbitant, though really no more than adequate; hence it arises, that fair-dealing teachers cannot, in many instances, obtain adequate remuneration. Loud complaints on the subject have been made to the author, whose own experience confirms the facts here stated.]]. The author was therefore urged to continue and extend his sketch; he in vain represented the difficulty of making it into a poem without new-modelling the subject, a task that he had neither time nor ability to execute. It was replied, that regularity of form was not regarded by them. "Go on (they exclaimed) we care not about form", and to their suggestion he yielded.

> So the author endeavoured to take up the cause
>
> By exposing mean tricks and explaining the laws;
>
> To caution the public against some impostors,
>
> Those self-named "professors" yclept dancing masters.
>
> How the task is performed, must be judged of by those
>
> Who well know the art, and such quackery oppose:

He has now explained his motives for writing, and the circumstances which gave rise to this little work, the object of which is to investigate the merits and claims of certain professors and teachers of dancing to that title ; to expose the delusive tricks and stratagems employed to obtain pupils ; also to explain the mode of admission to, and method of conducting certain rooms termed " Académies for Dancing", and to show the nature and quality of what are frequently called "Grand, Select, Characteristic, Friendly, Dress, Free, Subscription, and Charity Balls; likewise to enable teachers and the public Clearly to understand the laws relative to dancing, which are stated very fully in the work, and are also copied in the notes verbatim; from the act of parliament.

> Though he narrates in verse, no modern poet
>
> Deals less in fiction—(he has proofs to show if);
>
> If, circumstances should give room for doubt,
>
> He trusts his documents will bear him out,
>
> And show it is not invention, nor from spleen,
>
> But what exists, has been, or may be seen.

He is aware that the Danciad, in its present form, is not either a satyric poem or a dramatic piece; but,

> Regardless what the world may say,
>
> He has wrote the Danciad his own way;
>
> Has neither kept to rhyme nor rules,
>
> Nor tacked himself to ancient schools;
>
> But has, like Tristram Shandy gone
>
> Into digressions wide and long;
>
> From East to West, has breathless run,
>
> Then sauntered back where he began,
>
> Knowing sometimes variety
>
> Excuses impropriety;
>
> If readers ask the reason why
>
> He didn't with usual forms comply,
>
> His motives were for running riot,
>
> To caution rogues and make fools quiet.

Should his attempt succeed, it will be some consolation risking the censure of critics, for having deviated from established rules, but which, from the peculiar nature of the work, he considered it was sometimes necessary ; and that usual methods would have been ineffectual in exposing those sharks who have too long remained undiscovered, feasting on the silly gudgeons which come in their way.

Independent of the author's own knowledge on the subject, he has been supplied, during the progress of the work, through the medium of several professional persons, with accounts of various stratagems and devices of those self-created, self-entitled "Professors" till then unknown to him; and still

> There's some, who're not to justice yet been brought,
>
> Who've sinned for years, but never have been caught,
>
> But are well known, and cautioned to desist,
>
> As they'll be closely watched, should they persist.

He has withheld, for the present, the names of the parties alluded to; but, if he has not been sufficiently explicit, he must, in a future edition, be obliged, like a bad painter, to write the name at bottom.

> The author yet, has not disclosed the name
>
> Of those in fault, however they've been to blame;
>
> But should they think that their true picture's shown,
>
> And that they see a face just like their own,
>
> He grants to those, and all the cap may fit,
>
> His full permission now for wearing it.

But although he has refrained from naming the parties, yet, he trusts they will be easily discovered by their condemnation of the work and abuse of the author; for like the creaking wheel in the fable, it is very natural for them to cry out under affliction.

> If he's condemned by those he meant to hit,
>
> It will he a proof he has made his caps to fit,
>
> For when fools bark, and rogues begin to cry,
>
> There is a proof that retribution's nigh.

It is hoped the notes will show he has not taken up the subject without sufficient grounds for his assertions, for which he has ample confirmation, having in his possession most of the cards, bills, and advertisements issued by the parties.

He has entirely abstained from allusions to family circumstances, and personal misfortunes which ought never to be the subject of ridicule, although they have been, too frequently, to the disgrace of some of our best authors; and perhaps he might in some measure have been justified in retaliating even personalities, after the illiberality of certain parties, and he can affirm without fear of contradiction, that

> He's uninfluenced, aids no partial cause,
>
> Nor strives to censure, to obtain applause.

The Author's motives for this publication will probably be attributed to various causes; some persons will accuse him of self-interest, but he is quite convinced, if they had published as much, and as variously us he has, they would acquit him of that charge[[He, evidently, could not have been very sanguine in his expectation of gain from this work, which was laid aside for a year after the first representation, and afterwards resumed only at intervals spared from professional avocations, which be never suffered to be interrupted for such purposes, as _He remembers an adage, which struck him with awe, That "who lives with the muses, must die in the straw"_]]. Books published by a humble individual (not a bookseller) seldom pay even for paper and printing, much less any remuneration for authorship; he forms this opinion from his own experience, believing it to be well known that

> The author has, on dancing, published more
>
> Than any teacher ever did before.
>
> His works, though praised by teachers of renown,
>
> And bought by half the masters in the town,
>
> Have never yet enabled him to dine
>
> On sumptuous viands, nor with Tokay wine
>
> To treat his friends, and toast the sacred nine:
>
> He therefore fears his time's been badly spent.
>
> They ride who bought, he walks who did invent;
>
> And like some authors, printed to his cost,
>
> Has time, and labour, and invention lost,
>
> And had his brightest prospects often crossed:
>
> Yet, with this consolation, wrote again,
>
> That all great authors of the like complain;
>
> For works of merit do not always sell,
>
> And this sad truth even Milton once could tell.
>
> The drama next he was resolved to try,
>
> And for the stage, strove something to supply;
>
> To this was prompted, as heed heard it said,
>
> A thousand pounds for many a piece was paid;
>
> So he resolved to try with prose and rhyme,
>
> And strove to keep the unities of time,
>
> And printed too, did all within his power,
>
> And fondly hoped to catch the golden shower,
>
> To fill his coffers and extend his name,
>
> But that long looked-for shower never came,
>
> Like many authors, now, of self renown,
>
> Curses the taste and judgement of the town;
>
> Yet still writes on, and, for excuse, pretends
>
> He only writes to serve and please his friends,
>
> And has resolved another course to take,
>
> To try if he can't reparation make
>
> For loss in writing for the ball and stage,
>
> By lashing some impostors of the age.
>
> This to effect, he now to satire flies,
>
> And runs to Pope and Byron for supplies;
>
> For good examples, and what words to choose,
>
> And also how, and when, and where to use
>
> Triplets, digressions, and a clenching line,
>
> That in itself doth sound and sense combine,
>
> He reads them over, steals a line or so,
>
> His verse to strengthen, and his powers to show,
>
> But hopes the critics and the world won't know.
>
> At dancing masters he has bent his aim,
>
> But only those who have assumed the name.
>
> Some time ago, he warned them to desist,
>
> Or heed expose such plans as did exist
>
> To trick the public; but they still persist,
>
> And treat the author's warnings with a sneer,
>
> And cry "From such a wight there's nought to fear.
>
> His book will neither sell nor read, but soon
>
> Make paper lanterns to assist the moon".
>
> Should this take place, there's few with hopes of gain
>
> Would go his halves, and satisfied remain.

He therefore fears that the present edition will be the Alpha and Omega of the Danciad, unless some of the professors alluded to should recognize their own likenesses, and reply, thereby furnishing the author with new materials for another edition, in which he may probably be obliged to unmask some of those characters; but,

> Till they become the personal aggressors,
>
> He'll hide real names, and only use "professors".

Should these predictions be fulfilled, (as perhaps they may), no profit will accrue to him from the present publication.

With these apprehensions, he has printed only a very small edition, as his greatest expectations as to the sale do not extend beyond supplying his subscribers, and disposing of a few copies to those persons who may expect to see, in this work, the old adage verified, which says,

> "There's always rare sport (and with this hope will buy)
>
> To see a goose dance, and a fool versify".

Nor has he the expectation of a dedication fee. As the Danciad comes forth, without being dedicated, as usual, to a rich and noble patron, which is not, however, omitted in consequence of the author being too rich to refuse the fee, nor would his readers be easily persuaded he was induced to reject it on the score of independence, as

> The threadbare author, who, in sounding verse,
>
> Makes light of thousands, seldom has in purse
>
> Enough of current cola to answer all
>
> The rude demands of those who chance to call,
>
> And free his door from those alarming knocks
>
> Which give poetic ears such dreadful shocks;
>
> Or make the bard, for virtue's sake, disdain
>
> The great to flatter, for the hope of gain.

He fears his purse will not be the only sufferer, by the omission of a suitable dedication to some rich and noble patron, but that the public will never, in any other way, hear of the very extraordinary virtues and acquirements that such a patron must of course possess. Therefore,

> This may deprive the world of something they
>
> Could never hear of any other way,
>
> How his great patron was for wisdom famed,
>
> Whose modest virtues all the town proclaimed;
>
> Whose genius, talents, and acquirements, were
>
> Quite super human, and beyond compare:
>
> Such skill in arts and learning all confess
>
> None but rich patrons ever can possess.

The Author can assure the Public, that he did not withhold the dedication, nor dispense with the fee, in order to be revenged on the rich, for retaining all the money, and leaving him none, although he is often declaiming in defence of virtuous poverty; but the truth is, that he quite despaired of ever finding so kind and liberal a patron, having heard that

> Poets too oft, for want of bread, not fame,
>
> To gain a patron, have extolled his name;
>
> But, after sacrificing truth and time,
>
> Have often found that neither prose nor rhyme
>
> Could gain the bard the dedication fee,
>
> The patron was so mean or dull, that he
>
> The author's merit would or could not see.
>
> To gain a fee the author has no hope,
>
> For dedication fees expired with Pope[[It may not, perhaps, be strictly true, that no dedication fee has, in any instance, been given since Pope's time; but, since that period, it has certainly ceased to be the fashion.]].
>
> He therefore dedicates his piece to those
>
> Some of whom were and still may be his foes.
>
> He has been told it is prudent to be civil,
>
> And sometimes hold a candle to the Devil.

Not only has the author been without a rich patron and a dedication fee, but he has never received any pecuniary assistance from his subscribers in the publication of this work, the conditions being not to pay till delivery, and the price only 5s, whatever may be the size or extent of the book; beyond which he has only this forlorn hope, as

> His subscribers belong to the family race
>
> Of the Capers, well known for their figures and grace,
>
> Who he hopes are too proud and too rich to abuse
>
> A very good custom subscribers did use,
>
> When the copy's presented, the change to refuse.

This expectation, he fears, is only one of the poet's golden dreams, which perhaps will never be realized. Others, though they may not think authorship very profitable, would yet accuse him of motives of vanity; but he trusts that the following declaration will exonerate him from that charge, for

> He is not yet quite vain enough to give
>
> A card address to where he does not live;
>
> Nor boast of plenty, when the mice can show
>
> For want they left his cupboard long ago;
>
> Nor talk of dinners which he never ate,
>
> Nor run in debt to give a foolish treat;
>
> Nor vain enough, when he does hunger feel,
>
> To fast, because the hour is not genteel,
>
> Nor for the fashion to be starved alive,
>
> But eats at twelve, and will not wait till five.
>
> He's not ashamed to own he wanted pelf,
>
> Nor envies dancers better than himself;
>
> Is not abashed a former friend to meet,
>
> Because they knew each other in the Fleet.
>
> He boasts no conquests which he never made,
>
> Disowns no friends because they live by trade;
>
> Nor brags of means when be does hardly know
>
> Which way to turn, to escape from Richard Roe.

Although, after making this declaration, the author might be acquitted of either interest or vanity, yet there are some who might perhaps attribute this work to splenetic motives; but this he can affirm, (and, like many other authors, hopes to be believed too), that spleen has not in the least influenced him, not having any individual pique or personal animosity against any person alluded to in the work, only that natural indignation excited by the conduct of those who have resorted to the various deceptive tricks and unfair practices complained of, but must confess he cannot say quite so much for himself on the score of envy, as

> He envies those who can for nothing give
>
> Both time and dancing, yet like princes live;
>
> And all those teachers who have the art to show
>
> Their pupils dances, which themselves don't know;
>
> And those who to a lesson can foretell,
>
> (Be who they may) when pupils call dance well;
>
> And those who've had "machines[[The words in _italics_, between inverted commas, are taken from the party's bills and advertisements. The author would be much obliged to any Lady or Gentleman to supply him with any others of a similar kind: the favour shall be hereafter acknowledged.]] for waltzing made,
>
> To teach the art without a master's aid";
>
> And some great teachers, who do scarce know how
>
> To teach the chassée, or to make the bow
>
> Who never drudged for excellence or fame,
>
> Yet notwithstanding have acquired a name,
>
> And keep a carriage, live in great repute,
>
> Whilst talent walks, and in a threadbare suit
>
> And those "who've lately brought to light an art
>
> That common teachers never can impart".
>
> He envies those who any dance can take,
>
> And in six lessons perfect pupils make,
>
> And conscientiously to them can say,
>
> "You now dance well, can ease and grace display".

These and the several other super-human acquirements said to be possessed by certain professors of dancing, have excited the author's envy. In his defence, the calls on those eminent teachers who know the fallibility of human nature, to read these extraordinary professions, and then say whether they do not also envy those great professors such rare qualifications, and to this subject he particularly entreats the attention of eminent foreign dancers, who have so long laughed at our want of genius in the art of dancing.

> Read this, ye Opera principals, and own.
>
> Is not your system now defective grown?
>
> They perfect dancers make before you know
>
> The five positions, or can point the toe.
>
> Tell Gallia's sons, John Bull's now learnt to dance,
>
> Has got new methods, and can vie with France.

The Author's further remarks and opinions on these matters must be reserved for another place, as he finds he has already terribly digressed, for which he offers the following apology:

> Now, with critics a truce,
>
> For he has an excuse,
>
> Having seen near a score
>
> Who have done so before.
>
> Some are authors of note
>
> Whose names he could quote,
>
> Whose books, by confession,
>
> Are all a digression.
>
> You'll find Sterne and Swift
>
> Gave digressions a lift;
>
> And in Byron it is found
>
> That they often abound;
>
> Yet most will agree,
>
> That his like they can't see.
>
> If you say this excuse
>
> Will be here of no use,
>
> Perhaps there's one more
>
> That will outweigh a score,
>
> Which you must confess,
>
> If you reason possess.
>
> It is this: we are frail,
>
> And our foibles prevail
>
> For Dame Nature, we find,
>
> To our faults makes us blind.
>
> So the critics have said
>
> Of great Milton[[It is said of Milton, the poet, that he prized his "Paradise Regained" (considered by the critics as the most inferior of his poems) before his "Comus" and "Paradise Lost".]] that's dead.

Should neither precedents nor apologies prevail	— with some critics, who think

> He must jog on the usual way
>
> And neither look aside nor stray,
>
> Whatever the prospect may present,
>
> But keep the road that others went.
>
> Yet he has risked their indignation,
>
> And followed his own inclination,
>
> And often runs through thorns and briars,
>
> It expose impostors, rogues, fools, and liars.

That an author is not the best judge of his own performance, is generally admitted: whether the digressions into which the Author of the Danciad has been led are justifiable or not, and with what portion of ability he has executed the task assigned to him, he presumes not to determine; but, whatever opinion his readers may form on that subject, he at least hopes to be acquitted of unworthy motives. In yielding to the request of his subscribers, he has been influenced only by the wish of guarding the public against impositions, and of rescuing the honourable part of the profession from sharing in the odium that ought not to be indiscriminately attached. With such patrons and encouragers of his work, it may be doubted, whether he can say, like others, "he was prompted to the undertaking by the advice of his friends , for the old adage says, "two of a trade", &c.

He also hopes the unpoetical diction, as well as the want of smoothness in some of the lines, will be excused, the subject being rather argumentative than poetical, and the work abounding with technical terms and expressions, and it being requisite to quote, as closely as possibly, not only the modes of expression in particular advertisements, bills, and cards, but even clauses of the act of parliament relative to dancing.

> The critics, he hopes, will remember it was writ
>
> By a dancer, and they are not famed for their wit.
>
> Of the truth of this axiom to all he appeals,
>
> Per their merit, it is said, mostly lies in their heels
>
> And by one who has neither much leisure nor pelf,
>
> Who, when pupils apply, gives the lesson himself.
>
> If the author in triplets does largely abound,
>
> In Pope and in Dryden they're plentiful found;
>
> And even great Johnson advises their use,
>
> "Till, we've got something better we can introduce";
>
> And, should you dispute that they judgement did lack,
>
> You'll have Gifford, Southey, and Moore on your back;
>
> So, be how it may, if its merits are tried,
>
> He has authors and poets of note on his side,
>
> Who are known for their zeal, and whole volumes would write.
>
> In case of dispute, to prove themselves right,
>
> Should his subject and sentences end rather rude,
>
> Should his triplets not always the sentence conclude,
>
> Should his verse sometimes hobble and periods seem crude,
>
> He says, for excuse, that his subject's not epic,
>
> But argumentative, and partly dramatic,
>
> And hopes that this reason will weigh with the critic.

But it may, perhaps, be said that this apology might have been spared, had the Author engaged some able versifier to round his periods and correct his numbers, who certainly might have amended the poetry; but a technical knowledge of the subject was also indispensably necessary, as it appears was once experienced by Hogarth the artist, in his " Analysis of Beauty " who slates that he at first availed himself of the assistance of a literary friend, who not having a technical knowledge of drawing and painting, made rather an elegant literary disquisition than a scientific and technical treatise, and the artist was consequently compelled afterwards to write the work himself.

The Author of the following lines has, therefore, used his own mode, and if he has egregiously sinned against the rules of rhyme and reason, must in his turn expect to be subject, like others, both to reprehension and neglect.

Though the opening of the Danciad may be said to be on the subject of jealousy, and perhaps appear irrelevant to the object of the work, the original form has be en retained, as leading to other matters, and is now entitled, "the Introduction"; and though the imitations of the various styles and methods of dancing quadrilles, waltzes, reels, and country dances, cannot of course be properly explained, but by representation; yet, in order to preserve the form of the original sketch, he has retained the part where such imitations were introduced. The Laws relative to Dancing , the Subject of Public Balls , and above half that portion which is under the head of " Professors of Dancing "; were not in the original sketch, but, with various other alterations and additions, have been subsequently introduced.

It may be necessary to remark, that many circumstances appertaining to the same party are sometimes given in different places: this has arisen from their having partly transpired whilst the work was printing.

He fears the work will not please the critics the subject being not only limited but technical: however, should it satisfy those for whom it was written, he shall consider himself fortunate; and should it not, after his best endeavours, meet their expectation, they will recollect it was their approval of a portion of the work that induced him to finish it.

He also apprehends, that it may not please a respectable portion of the profession, who, though feeling the justice of the remarks, and assured they apply not to themselves, would yet be unwilling to concur in such sentiments, lest they should offend their visiting acquaintances, as

> There may be truth, too strong, perhaps, for those
>
> Who only tacitly such tricks oppose.
>
> But he speaks boldly, hides no faults for gain,
>
> And cares not if impostors should complain.
>
> Alike to him their censure or applause;
>
> He hopes with justice to maintain his cause.
>
> Though on him hurled Ernulphus's dread curse[[See the dreadful curse or excommunication from the church of Rome by Ernulphus.]],
>
> If he's traduced or slandered, which is worse.
>
> Though this should happen, he will not desist,
>
> But will expose impostors who persist.
>
> He'll not be neutral, but will speak his mind,
>
> Regardless if he friends or foes may find.

Notwithstanding which, he is, however, quite Willing to submit with deference to candid public opinion: yet

> He'll not be quietly condemned by fools,
>
> Or costermonger teachers, or their tools,
>
> But will reply, aye, over and over again,
>
> And prove he has grounds and reason to complain.
>
> Yet to be judged will willingly submit,
>
> By those who have candour, judgement, taste, and wit;
>
> And such as can the subject comprehend,
>
> And know the cause he labours to defend.
>
> If those condemn him, then he'll not complain,
>
> But either mend, or never write again.

The author fears, that with apologies, comparisons, defences, confessions, allusions, digressions, quotations, and invocations, both in prose and verse, he must, by this time, have tired his readers: he will therefore detain them no longer,

> Ending his preface with this exclamation
>
> To teachers and all pupils in the nation:
>
> "Let dancing-masters now draw near,
>
> "I'll whisper something in their ear,
>
> "That shall to some be recreation,
>
> "To others dire abomination.
>
> "Let those who've both cheap dancing dear,
>
> "(Pupils I mean) let them draw near,
>
> "And watch the shadows as they pass,
>
> " And see their likeness in the glass".

How far the conduct of the parties above alluded to has been fair and correct must be left to the judgment of those who are certainly most competent to decide, videlicet the scientific part of the profession. On the subject of the author's own case, he begs leave here to observe, that he was bred to a mechanical business, which, before the expiration of his at apprenticeship, he was compelled (with others) to relinquish, (that trade being entirely ruined through certain financial speculations of mister Pitt). Having some taste for dancing, as an amusement, he determined to endeavour to qualify himself so as to follow it, as a profession, and which was only effected after long and unremitting exertions, such as few individuals would encounter. With the particulars he may perhaps at some future period trouble the public, not fearing that, like some of his contemporaries, he can with anecdotes, digressions, quotations, &c. &c. fill two quarto volumes.]];

She remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct, as did the master of the booth, who, finding remonstrance only produced increased arrogance, became so enraged, that he was obliged to give the professor himself a lesson, not composed of graceful minuet steps, but of certain, violent, straight forward, kicking movements, which compelled him sore against his will, to make an ill-timed hasty chassee towards the door and thence suddenly a disgraceful exit, amongst the crowd, to the no small entertainment of the company and fiddlers at the ball, by many of whom he was well known. This anecdote was related to the author by an eye-witness to this transaction.]] (no matter where)

This induced two of his apprentices, just out of their time, to call on this great professor, in order to ascertain how it was possible for him to teach a dance known to him only by name. The professor. without hesitation, undertook to qualify them, and received money of them for that purpose, when an unlucky accident occurred which deprived them of the pleasure of seeing how he would have fulfilled his engagements, for on going into the practice room where they were invited, it being either a practice or ball-night, they were both known by one of the company; it was soon whispered round, who they were? The professor became alarmed and confused, and begged them to take back their money, as he heard they were teachers. This they refused, and called on him to fulfil what he had undertaken, repeating the words of his advertisement: "Professors, amateurs, &c. instructed". This, however, had no effect on the professor, who could not be prevailed on to impart his knowledge; and what he was able to teach to other professors has never yet been known.]].

	A ball-bill has recently been put forth by the professor alluded to, (who has been before noticed), printed in a particular manner. The words "Supper, Gratis," very large. The following extract will show how ingeniously it is contrived for the purposes of deception.

	### Mister ---'s ball, February, 1824.

	The splendor will surpass any thing of the kind ever witnessed.

	The band will consist of violins, flutes, clarionets, serpents, violincellos, double bass's, &c. but neither

His conduct seems the more extraordinary, from his having always wished to be ranked with the first class of teachers, and reprobated the low devices of unfair practitioners.

	The phrase "opera mice," does not allude to the first dancers, or to the liberal and honourable sons and daughters of Terpsichore, attached to that great theatre, (the wonder and delight of its visitors) but to some dancers belonging thereto, whose actions neither keep pace with their own words, nor with the size and creditor the establishment.

### Enter mister Chassée[[The author, in the publication of this work, intended to omit the scene with Chassée, as being too dramatic; but it has been retained by the advice of several professional persons, to whom it was read, who were of opinion that it was so characteristic of the manners, actions, egotism, and illiberality of certain well known parties, that it ought not to be omitted. It is of course now divested of that interest given to it in the representation, by the performer of the character, whose excellent imitation of their manners, and affected stile of dancing, not only demands the author's thanks, but must always live in the recollection of the company who were then present. This entire scene, with part of the previous dialogue, and the subsequent scene with Miss Frump, constituted the whole of the first sketch.]]. Belinda and Jemima _walk up the stage_

	J---'s W---ll, a public house, (yclept tavern) in Barbican, where a ball (some say a hop), has been for several years held every Saturday evening, under Professor W---r's direction. The assembly is indiscriminate; any gentleman may be a welcome guest on payment of one shilling; and the ladies, who usually attend, are for their well known good nature, admitted for sixpence. This assembly is said to be held and constituted not quite conformable to the provisions of the late Vagrant Act, nor to that of the 25th of George II, nor are its votaries awed by, the approach of the Sabbath, and obliged to quit at twelve o clock, as at the opera house and other public places.

	> For neither the professor nor mine host,
	>
	> Can of exemplary rigid virtues boast;
	>
	> Therefore to land their virtue is to quiz;
	>
	> With either or with both combined there is.
	>
	> No moral feeling, nor no pious awe,
	>
	> No stings of conscience, nor no dread of law;
	>
	> No fear of harlots, drunkenness, or riot;
	>
	> Nor Sabbath-breaking, nor of neighbour's quiet;
	>
	> No dread of honest wives and mother's curses,
	>
	> Whom sons and husbands leave With- empty purses;
	>
	> No scruples. Servants, prentice, and a punk,
	>
	> May come and dance, and if they please get drunk.
	>
	> There's no compunction, should the guests be found
	>
	> Smoaking aud drinking when the matins sound;
	>
	> They are not warned to leave their flowing bowls
	>
	> Because 'tis Sunday, to preserve their souls:
	>
	> No dread of watchman, should he ev'n come in,
	>
	> For he is silenced with a glass of gin;

	None of these apprehensions has either the professor or mine host. Why such an assembly, on a Saturday night, should have been for years permitted in the heart of the city, so near the seat of civic government, and should also have escaped the vigilance of the society for the suppression of vice, whilst a few respectable persons, assembled for amusement at a private house, were lately seized and taken before a magistrate: must be left to casuists to determine.

	That the professor Chassée was often at the Barbican balls, there is no doubt; whether for the purpose of displaying his, talents picking up pupils or selecting company for his own room, or for what other laudable purpose he best knows.

### Dances in a wretched and affected style

> Jem. That is a style, indeed! These steps would be
>
> I fear too difficult to teach to me.
>
> Chassée. I made those steps myself, to me alone.
>
> These brilliant graceful steps are only known;

> All other teachers methods are combined.
>
> Bel. You've doubtless, many masters had, to show.
>
> You all these methods, likewise all you know.
>
> Chassée. My knowledge from instinct and real genius came,
>
> Not from such quacks as now aspire to fame.
>
> For all they know, I at one glance could take;
>
> My Towsor he could better dances make;
>
> These creatures can do little more than talk,
>
> Not one in ten know even how to walk;
>
> From me they copy all; to me they are
>
> Indebted, even for their bills of fare.
>
> Bel. Do you to their academies ever go?
>
> As you their style of dancing seem to know.
>
> Chassée. I, from their pupils, who now come to me,
>
> Acquire their methods, and by this, you see,
>
> I all the knowledge of the town combine,
>
> With all those rare acquirements of mine
>
> For which I am known throughout the universe,

> And future ages will my praise rehearse;

> This causes teachers, who aspire to fame,

> To come to me to profit by my name.

> Bel. You must be skilled, why even your bill of fare,
>
> Contains such things, as makes most people stare.
>
> Chassée. I fifty dances teach, not mentioned there,
>
> Besides those composition of my own,
>
> Which are to the admiring town well known;
>
> I likewise have a new surprising dance,
>
> One which was lately brought to me from France;

>
> With your presence, those dances you shall see.
>
> Jem. You honour me, but, Sir, I must confess,
>
> I've really quite forgot your own address.
>
> Chassée. This card, Mademoiselle, does my address contain[[The address cards of many of those great professors, contain. not only the names of every fashionable dance, but have also generally the king's arms at the head; for many profess to be "under royal patronage", whose irons are only known to them by name.]],
>
> And all the various dances will explain,
>
> Whether composed by me with those I teach,
>
> For general use, the term I give to each.

### Presents card.

> Jem. Yours is a very handsome card address,
>
> The finest I have seen I must confess: —
>
> The arms, too! Well! really I am surprised!
>
> And then by royalty you're patronized.
>
> Chassée. I have that honour, and am proud to say
>
> I merit it: the reward's not thrown away:
>
> I trust my merit in quadrilles alone,
>
> Has made me to the dancing would well known.
>
> Bel. I've heard quadrilles are every night danced here,
>
> If so, I very awkward shall appear.
>
> Chassée. Do you know – La chaîne des dames et chassée croisée,
>
> Chassée ouvert, queue du chat et balancez[[Technical terms of figures and steps in quadrille dancing.]].
>
> Bel. I cannot say I understand them all,
>
> Although I danced them once at Almack's ball,
>
> I wish you would, sir, just perform L'été[[L'été a well known quadrille.]],
>
> And that will better put me in the way.
>
> Chassée. With pleasure, a quadrille I now will dance,
>
> With any in this country or in France.
>
> Bel. None can dispute it, sir, you're very kind.
>
> Chassée. This is the figure and the steps combined.

### Dances L'été. Belinda and Jemima laugh aside

> Bel. Thank you, sir. Now, Jemima, try my dear!
>
> How you can do it, for you need not fear
>
> Mister Chassée; I'm sure, he will excuse your dancing.
>
> Come, Jemima, don't refuse.
>
> Chassée. Don't be afraid, miss. Come, now, let me see,
>
> It is not expected you should dance like me;
>
> From one, like you, miss, I cannot expect,
>
> Great execution, grace, or stage effect.
>
> In dancing, there's but very few excel;
>
> Bel. I've many teachers seen, who can't dance well.
>
> Chassée. Very true, miss, there's many great impostors,
>
> Who always call themselves great dancing masters.
>
> Bel. In their exposure, I should take delight,
>
> It would serve such barefaced gross impostors right.
>
> Chassée. If I could see them well exposed, it would be
>
> The greatest pleasure you could give to me.
>
> [[To Jemima]]. Now, try the dance, miss, do not hesitate,
>
> That you may learn it well, and imitate
>
> My grace and manners: I will once again
>
> Dance it over, it will make it clear and plain;
>
> Then, give me your, opinion, and observe,
>
> Speak what you really think without reserve.
>
> Jem. At your request I shall speak out my mind,
>
> A flatterer, sir, me, you'll never, find;
>
> For flattery often makes bad dancers vain.

Chassée. Don't flatter, me, for flattery I disdain.
>
> Jem. Of that you'll have no reason, to complain.

### Chassée Dances; Jemima Imitates

> Chassée. That is the modern fashionable style;
>
> Now, miss, begin, I'll tune to you the while.

### Jemima Dances; Chassée Surprised and Confused

> Jem. Now, Sir, excuse the liberty I take,
>
> I've on your dancing some remarks to make,
>
> I'll stand corrected, if I cannot show,
>
> That something of the art I really know
>
> I've been at dancing since six years of age,
>
> And have for years had practice on the stage,
>
> From false positions all your steps you take;
>
> Third for fifth, and when the balloté you make,
>
> Your feet are so confined with turned up toes,
>
> That it is balloté, none could suppose;
>
> Your arms ungraceful then you bend your back
>
> And head, when dancing, like a half filled sack,
>
> You shake and wriggle, jerk about and swing,
>
> Like children's, puppets which they play with string;
>
> If such your manner, taste, and execution,
>
> Woe be to those who are under your tuition.

### Chassée Walks about Agitated Taking Snuff

> Chassée. Mercy! here's scandal, you're employed by those,
>
> Poor envious teachers, who my fame oppose.
>
> Jem. And, likewise, sir, I've heard with some surprise,
>
> You can't perform one half you advertise;
>
> To prove it scandal, you, no doubt, will show,
>
> That, you these dances accurately know;
>
> Here, from your card, sir, now suppose we take, The first three dances, and a trial make.

### Takes out a Card

> Chassée. Madam! I'll stay no longer in this place,
>
> As your transcendent merit would disgrace,
>
> By daring a professor to impeach,
>
> To say that I can neither dance nor teach,
>
> Is quite libellous, and to my face, too,
>
> To name my faults, O! Sacre Dieu!
>
> How dare you, miss, such vague opinions give?
>
> Such, impudence I never will forgive.
>
> Jem. Now, pray, sir, stay, give us another dance,
>
> One of those novelties you had from France.

### Exit Chassée in a rage

> Bel. Ha! ha! ha! I said you soon would-see,
>
> How well his words and actions do agree,
>
> He's a fair specimen of the same kind,
>
> Like him with ease I fifty more could find
>
> I wish they were exposed a little more.
>
> Jem. Of quacks, like these, I'd put to flight a score[[As the anther has noticed the excellent personification of the character of Chassee, it would appear unjust to omit mentioning also, the admirable manner in which the characters of Belinda and Jemima were performed. It ladies, equally competent, were occasionally to visit the assemblies of certain professors, it would make them hide their diminished heads, unless they possessed even more assurance than they are supposed to have, and that would be ---.]].
>
> There's one who keeps a gallimaufry hop[[Perhaps it might not be a libellous reflection on the above professor to say, he keeps a common hop, he may therefore be justly charged with presumption in pretending that his academy is on the principle of L'académie royale, Paris. If there are any who have visited both institutions, they can judge of the similarity; he is, however, imitated by another,person, superior to him in professional ability, though not in intellect or modesty.]],
>
> Thinks all his gagging brethren to overtop,
>
> Sends forth a bill of fare, "comme un François",
>
> Not to bring folks to dance, but fools to pay.

> "Academic Royale" meets the wandering eye,
>
> And "Paris" stands in capitals just by.
>
> To read the wording of his bill of fare,

> You'd think it came from Vestris or Albert.

> It is one who's long been kicked about by fame;

> And what he says or prints don't care a straw.
>
> When strangers call, they're plied with technic phrases,

	The author is well acquainted with the merits of many other dancers and teachers of equal excellence, and may perhaps take a future opportunity to do them justice. At present, he forbears naming individuals, more than necessary. In certain instances, it appeared right to contrast dancers of excellence in any particular department with pretenders to equal merit. Some names have therefore been selected, not intended to exclude merit in others.

	From a wish of avoiding, as far as possible, any invidious distinctions, the Author has been induced to abandon his original intention, of dedicating this work to an eminent teacher and dancer now retired, an excellent judge of the subject.

How these quadrilles are danced, can be easily imagined. Although these observations will be found to apply to the majority of dancers, yet it cannot be denied that Ball-room dancing has been much improved since the introduction of quadrilles, and that many amateurs may be found who would make certain professors ashamed of that title.]];

	It has lately been the practice with some professors of dancing when they have a ball, to call up their company to the dances, (i. e. to their places in the dance) with a charge on the trumpet, instead of the ever-commanding voice of the master of the ceremonies; thus making the ball room resemble a field of Mars, rather than the Temple of Terpsichore. It is done to give the idea of the company being too numerous to be summoned by the master's voice.

It appears that the gift has been obtained only six times during the last four hundred years, (videlicet) three times before the dissolution of monasteries in the reign of Henry 8th, and thrice since that period.]].

Some of the proprietors of these balls, or "professors" as they stile themselves, (though many of them notwithstanding they assume that title, have no more knowledge of dancing than some M. P.'s have of legislation), boast of gaining nightly two or three pounds by this practice, which, together with the profits they gain by liquors and refreshments support their establishments. Therefore, they do not depend on their abilities as teachers, to procure pupils; the quality either of the dancer or of the guest, is to them of no importance, numbers being all they want, to attain which, tickets are distributed amongst the company, but chiefly to the ladies, who they trust can influence the gentlemen; and thus large companies are obtained.]], and what the guest may spend,

### Grand Dress Balls

>
> Their guests trimmed out in Monmouth street fine clothes.
>
> I made enquiries, who, and what they were,
>
> And found some gents retailers in rag fair:
>
> With maids of all work, and some men of lace,
>
> In borrowed suits, this grand dress ball to grace.
>
> But their disguise could not impose on me,
>
> As by their manners I could plainly see,
>
> They neither had the manner, speech, nor gait,
>
> Of those they vainly strove to imitate.
>
> There was not one well dressed amongst them all,
>
> It was quite a mockery of a grand dress ball;
>
> Nothing like rule or order found I there,
>
> It was noise, dust, drinking, just like Greenwich fair.

### Grand Balls

> Their grand balls are the next upon rotation,
>
> On which I now shall make some observation.
>
> Grand is a title which they always call
>
> Each petty hop, that they misname a ball;
>

>
> As all they want is some good striking name.
>
> They try all sorts of titles that will strike
>
> The eye, no matter what, or how unlike;
>
> A striking title's all they have in view,
>
> They care not what, so it be great and new.
>
> The title "grand" on many does impose,
>
> Who know not what they are, and will suppose,
>
> They're what they should be, not what oft they are
>
> A rabble, only fit to grace a fair.
>
> A fight is as usual now at such a ball,
>
> As to see herrings retailed at a stall.

### Select Balls

> Wait for their partners, and never frown or scold.

> They don't resemble those, I fear you'll say,

> Than our old foes showed us, at Fontenoy[[It is related that at the commencement of the battle of Fontenoy, the English and French guards were drawn up opposite each other, and so near as to be within hearing, where they remained sometime motionless, waiting for each others fire: when the French Commander called out, "the French guards are waiting for the gentlemen of the English guards to fire first".

### Characteristic Balls[[The holders of these Balls know the illegality of holding Masquerades, but (as they are more attractive than the usual quadrille and country dance balls) the law is attempted to be evaded by giving them under the title of characteristic balls, (the nature of which is well understood by dancers), by which they hope to deceive the police, but deceive themselves sometimes to their cost, as they become equally amenable to the severe clauses in the Act of Parliament relative to Dancing Assemblies, (hereafter stated). Some of these ball holders have experienced the truth of these observations.]]

	A circumstance of this kind (which must be in the recollection of some of the readers) occurred in the year 1822. at the Assembly Rooms, in Kirby Street, Hatton Garden, then kept by a mister Smith, but now in the occupation of the Author of this work.

	Mister Smith was in the habit of letting his rooms indiscriminately for Masquerades and Public Dancing, though repeatedly cautioned on the illegality and danger of such proceedings; yet, the practice was continued till the Magistrates unexpectedly caused the parties to be apprehended on a warrant, under the Act 25th Geo. 2nd. The Proprietor could not be found; the company (after being detained in custody all night, and part of the next day, when they were publicly exposed, and reprimanded,) were at last permitted to depart, and with difficulty escaped the Tread Mill.

	A more recent instance has also occurred:

	A company of fifty persons who had assembled at mister Jackson's rooms, Ship Yard, Temple Bar, were taken before Sir Richard Birnie at the Public Office, Bow Street, on Tuesday 28th December, 1824; they were accompanied by mister Jackson, who was charged with holding Dancing Assemblies illegally, in unlicensed rooms. Mister J. observed, that no money had been taken at the doors, and handed in a ticket, the price of which appeared to be 3s. 6d. to admit a Lady and Gentleman. The Magistrate considered this an attempt at evading a license, but upon mister Lowe, a musician, stating that he had sold the tickets for his annual benefit, and that mister J. had lent him the rooms, and the officers stating that there was no person of known bad character among the company, the Magistrate was satisfied, and dismissed the charge, merely recommending the dancers to be cautious of assembling in unlicensed rooms.

	For a more particular account of this transaction, see "The News" of 2nd January, 1825.

	Though it appears the charge against these parties was dismissed, yet, had it been pressed, under the Act of Geo. 2nd, the Magistrate would have been compelled to send them to prison, and Mr. J. might also have been perhaps nearly ruined, through doing what he might have considered only as an act of humanity.

> This act you'll find the public did obtain[[This Act seems, ever since it was first passed, to have been almost unknown or greatly misunderstood by the parties whom it Chiefly concerns, (videlicet) teachers of dancing and publicans. The author recollects, that some years ago a penal action was brought (under this Statute) in the Court of K. B., against a mister Welling, who kept the Coach and Horses, in Holborn, and so little was the Act then known or understood, that he was supported by about twenty other Publicans, against whom similar actions were pending, not one of whom knew of the Act, and so confident were they of defeating the informers, that mister Welling (being persuaded by them) defended the action, on the ground that the company was respectable, and kept good hours--the defence availed nothing — the Plaintiff proved that dancing had been held at the Defendant's house, and that money had been received for admission, which constituted it "a place of public entertainment" within the meaning of the Act, and upon reading the penal clauses, a verdict was immediately given for the Plaintiff for £100, with double costs (£60). Mister Welling was entirely ruined by the action, — being utterly unable to pay the fine, he was obliged to quit his house, and retire into obscurity. Calendar (an Informer) afterwards brought various actions (under the same Statute) against other parties, none of whom ventured to contest the question with him, but were all obliged to compromise.]]

After reciting (amongst other things) "That the multitude of places of entertainment for the lower sort of people was a great cause of Thefts and Robberies, as they were thereby tempted to spend their small substance in riotous pleasures, and in consequence were put on unlawful methods of supplying their wants and renewing their pleasures, in order to correct as far as might be the habit of idleness which was become too general over the whole kingdom, and was productive of much mischief and inconvenience; It is enacted that after the first day of December, 1752, any House, Room, Garden, or other place kept for public Dancing, Music, or other public entertainments of the like kind, in the Cities of London and Westminster, or within twenty miles thereof, without a license had for that purpose, from the last preceding Michaelmas Quarter Sessions of the Peace, to be holden for the County, City, Riding, Liberty or Division, in which such House, Room, Garden, or other place is situate, (who are thereby authorized and impowered to grant such licenses as they in their discretion shall think proper) signified under the hands and seals of four or more of the Justices there assembled, shall be deemed a disorderly House or Place; And every such license shall be signed and sealed by the said Justices in open Court, and afterwards be publicly read by the Clerk of the Peace, together with the names of the Justices subscribing the same; and no such license shall be granted at any Adjourned Sessions, nor shall any fee or reward be taken for any such license; And it shall and may be lawful to and for any other person being thereunto authorized by warrant, under the hand and seal of one and more of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace of the County, City, Riding, Division, or Liberty, where such House or place shall be situate, to enter such House or place, and to seize every person who shall be found therein, in order that they may be dealt with according to law; And every person keeping such House, Room, Garden, or other place, without such license as aforesaid, shall forfeit the sum of £100 to such person as will sue for the same, and be otherwise punishable as the law directs, in cases of disorderly Houses. And it is thereby further enacted, that in order to give public notice what places are licensed pursuant to this Act, there shall be affixed and kept up in some notorious place over the door or entrance of every such House, Room, Garden, or other place kept for any of the said purposes, and so licensed as aforesaid, an inscription in large capital letters, in the words following, (videlicet) licensed pursuant to Act of Parliament of the twenty fifth of king George the Second, and that no such House, Room, Garden, or other place, kept for any of the said purposes, although licensed as aforesaid, shall be opened for any of the said purposes before the hour of five in the Afternoon, and that the affixing and keeping up of such inscription as aforesaid, and that the said limitation or restriction in point of time shall be inserted in, and made conditions of every such license. And in case of any breach of either of the said conditions, such license shall be forfeited, and shall be revoked by the Justices of the Peace, in the General or Quarter Sessions, and shall not be renewed, nor shall any new license be granted to the same person or persons, or any others on their behalf, directly or indirectly, for keeping any such House, Room, Garden, or other place for any of the purposes aforesaid.

	Proviso, that nothing in this Act shall extend to the Theatres Royal, in Drury Lane and Covent Garden, or the King's Theatre, in the Haymarket, or to any public entertainments carried on under Letters Patent, or license of the Crown, or the Lord Chamberlain.

	And it is further enacted, that any person entitled to any of the forfeitures by this Act imposed, may sue for the same by action of debt, in any of the Courts of Record at Westminster in which it shall be sufficient to declare, the Defendant is indebted to the Plaintiff in the sum of £, being forfeited by this Act, and the Plaintiff, if he recover, shall have full costs.

	Proviso that no action shall be brought by virtue of this Act, unless commenced within six months after the offence committed.

	And it is enacted, that this Act should be in force three years and no longer.

	Three years afterwards, the above Act was made perpetual.

> I'll briefly state the act of Parliament —
>
> "Any house, garden, room, or tenement,
>
> Kept for public dancing, or entertainment,
>
> In London, Westminster, or twenty miles around,
>
> In which there shall be public dancing found".
>
> Without a license, then, will subject those

> The law, for strange to say, but it is the fact,

> You may be punished by the Vagrant act;

> With penalties and fines the act abounds[[The penalties in this Act it will be seen are very severe — £100 for every offence (besides costs). The parties are also liable to be indicted under the Vagrant Act, and sent to prison to hard labour, and as is now the fashion, committed to the Tread Mill. Public Concerts are equally subject to the oppressive penal clauses of the Act, for regulating places of public amusement, which clauses are so little known, that must of the tavern keepers and publicans in London at times render themselves liable to them, as do also those dancing masters who hold such assemblies at their rooms, as they are not exempt from the operation of this Act, on account of their profession, though such an erroneous notion has prevailed.]],

> The penalty's each time, one hundred pounds;

> Another time this matter we'll debate,

> But now I am anxious just to hear you state
>
> When, where, and how, are licenses obtained,
>
> For public dancing – this you've not explained.
>
> Jem. If you for dancing would a license take,

> At Michaelmas quarter sessions you must make

> The clerk their names must publicly report,
>
> "That they have granted unto A or B,

> It is likewise requisite to mention here,

> Until St. Michaelmas returns, then you
>
> This license at the sessions must renew;

To several of those gentlemen Publicans have applied (as the Author knows) for leave to hold Balls at their houses, and though the permission has been generally refused, yet their Worships never stated it was not in their power to give such permission; they never pointed out the penal clauses of the Act of 25th George the Second, nor gave any caution on the subject to the applicants, who were only warned as to late hours, improper company, &c. and to keep the peace.]], for magistrates have been

> Let them take warning, think of costs and debt,

> Which in "professors" should have been related.
>
> Bel l. The greatest generals often retrograde,
>
> To gain new strength against those whom they invade;

> Jem. One in a broadside of large double crown,

> Proclaims "superior dancing" to the town[[An anonymous bill has been put forth by some teacher, announcing that "at the Academy for dancing in C--- Street, superior dancing is taught at one-third the usual charges."]];
>
> And what's more cheering, with some sage advice,
>
> Says he'll instruct you at one-third the price
>
> Of any who can boast of equal fame;
>
> But our professor does not give his name.
>
> Bel. Perhaps professor's modesty may be,
>
> The reason we in print his name don't see.
>
> Jem. Then he's not like some brethren of the toe,
>
> Who hack their names like Messrs. Doe and Roe,

> And put them up in types of various dye,
>
> To attract the crowd, and catch the passers by;
>
> Bel. Names sometimes are for reasons kept concealed,

> And only are from circumstance revealed.
>
> I've known some persons who remained in cog:
>
> For reasons why some donkeys wear a clog:

> Jem. Perhaps, Professor like, some lords of state
>
> Remain in cog; to compass something great;
>
> And hides his name from charity, to those
>
> Poor puny souls, who dare his fame oppose,
>
> And by surprise, will on some future day
>
> Break forth, and his astounding name display;
>
> His rivals will be in the distance hurled,
>
> And our professor pose the dancing world.
>
> The town will then no doubt a deference show

### Friendly Balls

> From this digression I shall now review
>
> What are called "friendly balls", and prove to you,
>
> They are only friendly as to name – for those
>
> Who hold those balls are certain to impose,
>
> On all who go; by stratagem or fraud
>
> They trick their guests, and then themselves applaud;
>
> If to these balls you should gain free admission,
>
> You'll not (depend on it) also get permission
>
> To place your hat or cloak just where you please,
>
> For they are kept till payment of the fees;
>
> Which they with care exact from one and all,
>
> Both friends and foes, who do attend their ball.
>
> Bel. What fees are those, which they presume to take?
>
> Jem. A sort of rate or levy which they make
>
> On every one who goes – this is the way
>
> That they contrive to make all dancers pay.
>
> When you go in[[Much time and trouble were formerly bestowed by the dancing master in teaching the use and management of the hat, particularly how to eater a room with it, and the proper mode of carrying it when not used in the dancing; but modern Professors are now spared that trouble, by their servants demanding the hats previous to admission to the ball room — the profits arising from this practice, have induced them to dispense with this part of ball room etiquette.]], your hat or cloak they take,

> Then on the wearer a demand they make

> Of certain money, as the usual fee —
>
> To pay it ere you dance, you must agree.

> This they pretend is the perquisite of those,

> Who have the care of bonnets, hats, and clothes;

> A mere pretence! the proprietor it is known,
>
> Gives only poundage, makes the rest his own.
>
> If you comply, there's still one more condition
>
> Must be fulfilled, before you gain admission
>
> To join these balls, a coffee ticket they[[Though this may not be the universal practice at all the Balls alluded to, yet it is at any rate the practice at several.]]
>
> Present you with, and then for which they say,
>
> Before you enter, you must also pay.
>
> When gentlemen bring ladies to their ball,
>
> These teachers charge their coffee – this they call
>
> The general practice, and a usual thing,
>
> For gentlemen to pay for those they bring;
>
> Such regulations it is but fair to state,
>
> Do chiefly to the gentlemen relate —
>
> For these professors do a difference show
>
> Betwixt ladies and gentlemen – ladies, they know,
>
> To dances unprovided often go.
>
> They therefore are let off at small expense,
>
> And only pay by way of recompense,
>
> A sixpence for the care of what they bring[[At these balls, sixpence only is the sum usually demanded of each of the ladies.]],
>
> Cloak, hat, or shawl, or any such like thing.
>
> Teachers for pay on gentlemen depend,
>
> Trust each will treat his partner and her friend;
>
> For at refreshment, it is the usual plan,
>
> To place two ladies to each gentleman;
>
> Not ladies of the very squeamish kind,
>
> But such as at these hops and balls you find;
>
> Who'd not refuse a drop of you know what,
>
> If at free cost it can with ease be got:
>
> Who would not fear on Sunday's, as in France,
>
> To leave the church, and join a country dance.
>
> In pious matters they're not very nice,
>
> But hate the whole "society of vice";
>
> Not like some pious senators that cry,
>
> Because some thousands still in errors die,
>
> Nor listen to advice from mistress Fry[[Mistress Fry. — A pious lady of the Society of Friends, who has taken great pains to reform the profligate in prisons and other places, by means of religious lectures and discourses.]].
>
> But many can (oh! shocking!) curse and damn,
>
> And would not fear to ride the old black ram[[According to the custom of a certain manor, a widow holds her lands only (dum sola et casta) whilst she continues single and chaste, but the steward is bound to restore them in ease of forfeiture, on condition of her riding backwards on a black ram into the Court, and publicly acknowledging her frailty by repeating certain verses. There is a humourous account of a transaction of this kind in the Spectator.]];
>
> Who are not so nice as to refuse to eat,
>
> Because it is the gentlemen who treat;
>
> Or should the matter be disputed, they
>
> But seldom, for themselves insist to pay.
>
> Those ladies often with the master join,
>
> To increase the bill and favour his design;
>
> For services like these he does admit
>
> Them gratis, and such ladies they think fit
>
> To introduce – but for this favour then,
>
> They there must introduce some gentlemen,
>
> For to subscribe to something they may call
>
> A dress, select, or grand, or fancy ball.
>
> One has a scheme[[A Professor who holds a weekly Ball, and collects his company in the manlier and for the purposes described in the note in p. 120, is somewhat more indulgent than others of his brethren, in permitting his guests to dance before they take their coffee tickets; but being aware that many young men must leave before eleven o'clock, therefore to oblige them to take coffee which is seldom toady quite so early, when they apply for their hats, &c. &c. to their surprise, these things are locked up, and the servant not to be found till after the coffee is over. Thus they have been obliged to return to the Ball Room, and take refreshment against their will; many have complained of this practice.]] superior to the rest,

> Of their finesse, than I e'er knew before.

> Jem. There's still one project I have not yet stated[[The circumstance above stated, together with several others, having been communicated to the Author since the first part was published, is now inserted here at the request of some Subscribers, though not strictly in the proper place, rather than wait for a second edition.]],
>
> Which in professors should have been related.
>
> Bel. Let's hear it – time and place shall be excused,
>
> I seek to be instructed and amused.
>
> Jem. To pass off damaged ware, street hucksters cry,
>
> (To ease your doubts) come, "taste before you buy";
>
> But if you taste, and should refuse to deal,
>
> You'll soon the merits of their candour feel.
>
> Bel. That's very true – it is what they call a lay:
>
> For those who taste, are always made to pay.
>
> There's some Professors I can't mention here,
>
> Who of connection have some ground for fear;
>
> To fill their Rooms, they to the town now bawl,
>
> "Two lessons gratis if you join our ball[[The Professors alluded to being conscious of their slender connections, and despairing of the ordinary means of filling a ball room, have (in imitation of the "supper gratis and trumpet schemes", vide page 40 and 130) hit upon the project of advertising to give two lessons gratis to any persons going to their ball.]]".
>
> It is meant to rival (may be plainly seen)
>
> The "Supper gratis", and the trumpet scheme;
>
> For these poor souls, if they can't boast of wit,
>
> With some device all strive to make a hit.
>
> Jem. They soon will teach you all you want to know,
>
> If you to these professors balls will go:
>
> We therefore shortly may expect to meet
>
> Teachers with fiddles, playing in the street
>
> "Stoney Batter" to Macadamizers,
>
> Or with a board turned walking advertisers;
>
> Or using steps (not chassées, more is the pity)
>
> To hawk some golden bubble through the city.

### Free Balls

> Bel. The free balls I could wish you'd next review,
>
> That I may know, if what is said, is true
>
> Concerning them; for I've heard many say,
>
> Though they're called free balls, you are made to pay.
>
> Jem. Those miscalled free balls often do disgrace
>
> Their title, the proprietor, and place
>
> In which they're held; instead of free balls, they
>
> Who hold them, always make all comers pay[[Those who suppose these free balls are given through the proprietor's generosity, will find themselves very much deceived. The proprietors have two objects in view, (videlicet) notoriety, and the profit of refreshments, which, with the hat and cloak money, generally make ample amends to them for their supposed liberality.]],
>
> Either for music, room, or hat, or clothes,
>
> Or something else they claim, or else propose
>
> With whips and fresh demands to make amends,
>
> For "giving dancing gratis to their friends?"
>
> You'll find these free balls all on the same plan[[The author, sometime ago, was taken by a gentleman to one of these free balls; at the end of the second dance a collection was made for the music, and in about half an hour afterwards another collection for refreshments, of which a very spare quantity was supplied, not one-fifth of what was subscribed for, and before they left the Ball, a similar demand was made for lighting up the room, fires, &c. The ladies there were not exempt from these levies.]] —
>
> Go there, and dance at free cost if you can;
>
> For our professor's "gratis" is the lure,
>
> Who shows the cheat when he has guests secure.
>
> Girl, boy, or serving man is welcome guest,
>
> And maids of all work figure with the rest;
>
> For these free balls, they mostly get their belies
>
> From Conduit Gardens, or from Bagnigge Wells;
>
> From playhouse lobbies, waiting for a call,
>
> Ladies are brought, to grace professor's ball;
>
> Welcome all comers! no matter who or what
>
> They be – from all, there's something to be got,
>
> Either for hat or cloak, or what they spend;
>
> The object's gain, whatever they pretend[[Those who have attended the free balls given by these professors of dancing, will find the author pretty correct in the description of the parties attending them.]].
>
> I've heard such fights do at these balls take place,
>
> As any other ball room would disgrace;
>
> But these professors and their guests you'll find,
>
> Are not of the reflecting squeamish kind;
>
> They're used to fights, to tippling, noise, and riot,
>
> And quite unused to order, rule, and quiet.
>
> Bel. Such rude fracas their belles must terrify!
>
> Jem. By no means, they have more philosophy.
>
> They're not those squeamish dames who'd be ashamed
>
> To hear an oath, or "ladies garters" named;
>
> Who will look down when they approach a man,
>
> And always hide their faces with their fan:
>
> Or those, who would a double entendre dread,
>
> When beaux change cards, are carried out for dead:
>
> Or those who think they're ruined with a kiss,
>
> Or would resign their place to each pert miss:
>
> Or those who are at twelve resolved to go,
>
> And leave the ball, likewise a favourite beaux;
>
> Who would drink water, and good wine oppose,
>
> And dread a crowd, although composed of beaux:
>
> Who never talk but when in time and place,
>
> Who never move or dance but with a grace:
>
> Who'd rather go to church, and say their prayers,
>
> Than go to balls and dance to quadrille airs;
>
> Who never slandered rivals friends or foes,
>
> Nor envied others jewels or fine clothes;
>
> Who rail at men, and mean the whole they say,
>
> Who'd rather pray and work, than dress and play:
>
> Nor those who tell their age and never scold,
>
> Who think they're ugly, and would gain be old.
>
> These are not ladies who such balls attend,
>
> They're very different belles, you may depend;
>
> The gentlemen who at these balls you find,
>
> Are as to manners of a similar kind;
>
> They've none of that retiring self command,
>
> When they applaud to merely move the hand,
>
> But clap their hands like vulgar low coal heavers,
>
> And make them sound like marrow bones and cleavers.
>
> For noise and gesture these ball guests you'd say,
>
> Resemble dancing sweeps the first of May.

### Fancy Dress Balls

> Fancy dress balls must as the next appear,
>
> And what they really are you now shall hear.
>
> Fancy dress balls, some people likewise name[[The fancy dress balls held by the teachers alluded to, are generally found to be masquerades in disguise.]]
>
> Characteristic, and think they are the same;
>
> (But characteristic as I just have said,
>
> Is meant to signify a masquerade),
>
> a fancy dress balls that, where every guest
>
> Is in appropriate costume strictly dressed;
>
> The face to show the character, and age
>
> They paint, as is the custom of the stage;
>
> The mask's forbid the countenance to aid,
>
> For "fancy ball" means not a "masquerade".
>
> Grand fancy balls have oft been given at court,
>
> Where royalty has sometimes deigned to sport,
>
> Like those which Bath and Almack's now supply,
>
> For taste and fancy with the Court that vie;
>
> Or those which Ranelagh[[The fancy dress balls held at this once celebrated place, were visited by all the fashionable world, amongst whom several branches of the Royal Family were known to mingle--for rank and consequence these Balls were superior to any others in England, and have never since been equalled. Fancy Dress Balls from the variety of character that may be introduced, may be rendered superior to any others. Besides those given at Court, Almack's, Bath, &c. one was given some years ago at Liverpool, of the most magnificent description, at which all the families of rank within the surrounding distance of many miles were present. For variety of character and original costume, this splendid Ball has never been surpassed.]] did once contain,
>
> The like of which will scarce be seen again;
>
> But quite unlike such splendid balls are those
>
> Which these professors give, though you'd suppose
>
> From their announcement, that they're still the same;
>
> But they resemble only in the name —
>
> Go to those teachers balls, you then will see
>
> They're nothing like what they pretend to be;
>
> Instead of various characters arrayed
>
> In strict costume, where fancy has displayed
>
> Her boundless whim, to variegate the scene,
>
> Where all the costumes of the world are seen,
>
> Where ages past before you seem to rise,
>
> And strange outlandish beings meet your eyes;
>
> And habits, manners, customs, all are shown
>
> With strict exactness, though before unknown,
>
> Where you the world in miniature may view,
>
> Objects antique, familiar, strange, and new:
>
> Egyptians, Medes, and Greeks walk to and fro,
>
> In costumes worn three thousand years ago.
>
> (When these were nations the most famed on earth,
>
> Where science, arts, and learning had their birth;
>
> But, strange reverse! they're now in darkness hurled,
>
> Who once gave laws and learning to the world).
>
> Here the swift Parthians your eyes will meet,
>
> So famed for victory in their feigned retreat;
>
> In the mind's eye here Marathon you see,
>
> And Salamis and famed Thermopolae;
>
> And gay Palmyra's palaces (no more),
>
> And ancient Troy whose loss we all deplore.
>
> This mutability of human kind,
>
> Must bring some strange reflections to the mind,
>
> And make us cry, oh! Time what hast thou done,
>
> Whither are Tyre, and mighty Babylon?
>
> And lofty Thebes and Ninevah all gone.
>
> And famous nations now all swept away,
>
> The wonder and the terror of their day;
>
> With other wonders history has displayed,
>
> By art produced, and by old time decayed —
>
> At balls like these all may be entertained,
>
> As characters are generally sustained
>
> By those of talent, who can represent
>
> The characters just as dame nature meant.
>
> But at these teachers balls there's not the kind
>
> Of costume I've described – their guests you'll find
>
> Are mostly dressed in their own walking clothes,
>
> Not Fancy Dresses, as you might suppose.
>
> Should persons there in character be found,
>
> They in low slang and ribaldry abound;
>
> They're so unlike to what they represent,
>
> You only by the dress know what is meant;
>
> And at some fancy balls where I have been,
>
> Not even one in strange costume was seen.
>
> Bel. Such balls are meant as catch pennies, by those
>
> Who laugh at all on whom they do impose.
>
> Jem. These teachers care not what they advertise,
>
> Their placards, like themselves, are filled with lies;
>
> Bel. But strangers oft too readily believe
>
> In all they hear and see, and thus deceive
>
> Themselves, who then become the dupes and prey
>
> Of every rogue and sharper of the day.

### Lady Patronesses Balls

> Bel. I hear some great professors have of late
>
> Been striving much to imitate the great,
>
> In holding balls where they themselves elect
>
> Patronesses[[Certain Balls given by the nobility are managed by a select number of ladies patronesses; the office is considered both honourable and enviable, each lady having particular privileges, (including the indisputable right of approval or rejection of company). In imitation of these, some modern teachers pretend to hold similar balls, at which the ladies nominated by the professor have only the honour of the office, without any power whatever; though the pretence is that they are appointed for the purpose of keeping the company; select, yet they are not permitted to exercise the right of rejection of any party, as that might interfere with the proprietor's own interest.]], to keep their balls select.
>
> Jem. That's not the object, I will plainly show,
>
> As I the motives of these gentry know;
>
> For their real object, boldly I'll maintain,
>
> Is not propriety, but hope of gain;
>
> How that's effected, I will now explain,
>
> It is done to feed the vanity of those
>
> Fair ladies, who the company compose,
>
> Who never see the drift, but think it fine,
>
> If they as lady patronesses shine.
>
> Bel. With such mock quality, the thing's absurd,
>
> How their election's made, I've never heard;
>
> No doubt the greatest talent is preferred.
>
> Jem. You are mistaken, talent has no avail,
>
> Money and interest only will prevail;
>
> None are elected here by public voice,
>
> The great professor only has the choice;
>
> From all the ladies he pretends to choose,
>
> Those wanting means and interest he'll refuse;
>
> For talent without means here, as at court,
>
> With these professors meet with no support.
>
> As proof this office is bestowed for gain,
>
> A child for once this honour did obtain[[A little girl of twelve or thirteen years of age was appointed to the office of lady patroness at one of these balls.]].
>
> Bel. These selfish wights it is plain now to perceive,
>
> Entirely live by those whom they deceive;
>
> Another question I must ask you – pray
>
> How long in office do these ladies stay?
>
> Jem. They have the honour only for one night,
>
> Succeeding Balls give other dames that right;
>
> One lady may two following nights preside,
>
> But she must pay to gratify her pride;
>
> In either meal or malt, – he is not nice,
>
> But one or both will have, if yon serve twice.
>
> Bel. When these fair dames this envied office fill,
>
> Have they full power, and can they act at will?
>
> Jem. They're patronesses only by the name,
>
> But have no power to perform the same;
>
> It is true they have the title for the night,
>
> But, mark me! these fair ladies have no right
>
> To give admissions, neither to reject
>
> Strangers from entering, though the ball's select;
>
> The great professor's interest is at stake,
>
> They therefore dare not these objections make;
>
> There's one thing more quite requisite to say,
>
> When chosen once, if absent, fines must pay.
>
> Bel. What! fine the ladies! mercy! how absurd!
>
> The most ungallant practice ever heard!
>
> How, or by what means do they exact the fine?
>
> Jem. One great professor levies it in wine[[These Ball holders are very particular in exacting their fines — even the ladies are not exempt, if they fail attending punctually to the minute; the Professors sometimes receive these fines in kind; one of them takes it, generally, in wine.]].
>
> Bel. That fining ladies is a barbarous plan,
>
> It surely could not emanate from man.
>
> Jem. Ladies must now wear pockets, and what's worse,
>
> To fill the office will require a purse.
>
> Bel. When once appointed "Lady patroness",
>
> What is the office? What do they profess?
>
> Do they as stewards and directors act,
>
> And all the duties of the ball transact?
>
> Do they the ball-room etiquette well know,
>
> And technic terms? Can they the figures show
>
> Of all the various dances now in use,
>
> Quadrilles, the Spanish dances and batteuse,
>
> With English country dances, ecosoise,
>
> The figured reels and stately polonoise?
>
> Do they call out "your places, sirs", and say
>
> "Come, show your number – is it B or A?"
>
> Does their official duty thus extend
>
> That they the gentlemen should recommend
>
> To lady partners, and the ladies suit
>
> With such nice beaux as ladies can't dispute?
>
> Jem. They know no more of what you have here laid down,
>
> Than children know the manners of the town[[It is well known by those who have attended these Balls, that neither talent nor experience has the least influence with the Proprietors in the election of the ladies patronesses, as many have been appointed to that office who were totally unacquainted with dancing, and were equally ignorant of the etiquette of the ball room.]];
>
> For many a patroness has never seen
>
> A ball, or e'en a month at dancing been.
>
> At Almack's balls the patronesses there
>
> Not only have to make the bill of fare,
>
> But choose as guests such as they may think fit;
>
> None but those patronized will they admit;
>
> But our professors take a special care,
>
> Such privileges their ladies never share.
>
> These balls at most can have no other claim,
>
> Than paltry imitations, and the name.

### Charity Balls

> Charity balls do likewise now abound,
>
> There's scarce a week but new ones may be found;
>
> The holders of these balls not only state
>
> Some direful tale, but oft exaggerate;
>
> They have different methods, yet they all agree
>
> In calling on the world for charity.
>
> "Fire and famine" oft their placards head,
>
> Or else the name of same good soul just dead;
>
> They various objects have, for some profess
>
> "A widow's call", some " children in distress[[At one of these balls, purporting to be "for the benefit of a widow and fatherless children", it was discovered, in the course of the evening, that it was in fact for the benefit of a certain teacher of dancing in the habit of holding assemblies at various places under such pretences. On the discovery of this circumstance the company broke up, and endeavoured to make the professor refund; — those who know him may easily guess at the result of this undertaking. The circumstance was communicated to the author by the proprietor of the rooms where the ball was held.]]".
>
> Others (to gain the stewards some renown)
>
> Propose relief to half the poor in town.
>
> Strangers, who read, if they believe, must own
>
> That all mankind are philanthropic grown.
>
> Bel. I cannot help applauding the intent,
>
> When charity by them is really meant.
>
> Jem. It is praiseworthy and kind, all must confess,
>
> To give to objects really in distress.
>
> I've seen subscriptions for some persons made,
>
> Who constantly make charity a trade,
>
> Whilst modest merit often starves unknown,
>
> Afraid to ask, ashamed their case to own;
>
> While insolent and public paupers share,
>
> Unmerited, both means and sumptuous fare.
>
> From all who grievous tales of want relate,
>
> The public seldom can discriminate
>
> The real deservers, and too often give
>
> To those wire as impostors wholly live.
>
> I have known some cases, which at balls occurred,
>
> The truth of which by many is averred,
>
> How persons have obeyed a widow's call,
>
> And taken tickets to support her ball;
>
> And that they might the worthy object aid,
>
> Have previously for all their tickets paid;
>
> Yet when these friends do at the ball attend,
>
> They find their charity they must extend,
>
> The room and band to pay for, or else they
>
> Must pocket the affront, and go away[[Contributions for tickets have been levied on the benevolent under various pretences of char table purposes, and they have on some occasions been called upon to pay also for the music and the expense of the room.]].
>
> But all do not subscribe the cause to serve,
>
> Nor does their charity that name deserve.
>
> Bel. It is not all gold that glitters, you well know,
>
> For half their charity's mere outside show.
>
> Jem. Many to have their names in print subscribe,
>
> And make their charity a sort of bribe.
>
> As some subscribe through vanity alone,
>
> And others hope for faults they shall atone;
>
> And some propose these balls in hopes to gain
>
> Some office they've not merit to obtain,
>
> As stewards or directors[[Many are in the habit of taking tickets for charity balls, expressly for the purpose of being appointed to the above offices, though by no means qualified to fill them.]], or to be
>
> Appointed masters of the ceremony;
>
> A badge of office on their clothes to wear,
>
> A band or star, or else a wand to bear;
>
> These honours on them awkward do appear,

> Like school boys who break up but once a year.
>
> Such self-created jacks in office, are

> For self sufficiency beyond compare:
>
> These officers do often privilege take,
>
> By right of office, and for privilege sake;
>
> Give free admissions to their friends, that they
>
> May dance, though they've no charity to pay,
>
> The dancing at these balls, in general, is
>
> Nice sport for dancers, if they choose to quiz:

> Many stand up to dance, though they don't know

> A step or figure, or which way to go;
>
> But, in confusion, run about and stare,

> You might as well strive to convert the Pope;
>
> For ignorance is never wrong, they say,

> Like pig on rope, they plunge on their own way.

> These Balls do teachers harm, for many go

> To dance, who not one step of dancing know,
>
> But jump about and satisfied remain,
>
> And think all right, if nobody complain.

> Six lessons[[Six lessons is the usual number fixed by these Professors for completion, in any department of dancing.]] often make a feel presume

> To take the lead, and consequence assume,
>
> If he can through a figure blundering go,

> These charity balls produce a spurious race

### Annual Balls

> The annual balls I'll next explain, that you
>
> May see these Balls brought fairly into view;
>
> There's scarce a teacher, either great or small,
>
> But every season has his annual ball.
>
> Some teachers have their annual balls, which are
>
> Thus named, you'll find, the public to ensnare;
>
> They call them thus in hopes it may appear
>
> They only have one ball within the year[[Some of these ball-holders have been known to have several "Annual balls" in the season; their motives appear to be to induce the belief, that every one announced under that name, was the only Ball intended to be held during the season.]].
>
> To miss it, some couldn't satisfied remain,
>
> Until that day twelve month should come round again;
>
> But when they've been, what must he their surprise!
>
> Another Annual Ball next mouth supplies,
>
> Which makes these people scarce believe their eyes;
>
> Who little know the great professor's aim
>
> Is to catch strangers by some specious name.
>
> Bel. To account why annual balls come round so soon,
>
> They reckon years, like Hindoos, by the moon;
>
> They thus may have twelve "annual balls" a year,
>
> And make the time quite reasonable appear.
>
> Jem. They seldom care for what the world may say,
>
> If they draw strangers to their balls to pay;
>
> Many print "Annual balls", and what's still more,
>
> Were never known to have a ball before;
>
> They think it will pass them off upon the town,
>
> As long established and of some renown.
>
> They number them like tickets for a ball,
>
> As their first number's never very small;
>
> Mostly with twenty they begin, to show
>
> They've long taught dancing, and the art must know;
>
> Yet some of these professors, I'll engage,
>
> Are not much more than twenty years of age.
>
> One has Parisian balls[[One Professor, to avail himself of a name, has what he calls "Parisian balls;" but these supposed French balls are nothing more than common every-day dances.]], but those who dance
>
> Find nothing at them like those held in France;
>
> The name is all you'll find that's French, the rest
>
> Is but a common English dance at best.

### Subscription Balls

> Subscription balls must next attention claim,
>
> Those by impostors held that bear the name;
>
> Who advertise them on our gentry's plan,
>
> And seem to imitate them all they can.
>
> Bel. In title only, for their plans you'll find,
>
> When they're compared, are of a different kind;
>
> It is true that they Subscribers strive to gain,
>
> And try all means their money to obtain.
>
> A term of balls they will engage to give,
>
> Which seldom is completed whilst they live[[Several of these ball-holders give out proposals for holding what they call "Subscription balls", professedly on the plan of those at Almack's; the pretended object is, by subscription, to make their balls respectable and select, but the real motives are to induce parties to subscribe at once for a certain number of balls — but were the existence of the dances to be as long as the age of Methusalem, they would not see the engagement complied with.]];
>
> They care not how nor whom they do admit,
>
> All that bring money they make amply fit
>
> To join these balls, not like the rich and great,
>
> Who to subscribers often hesitate,
>
> If they're not of high birth, rank, and station,
>
> And oft refuse great lords of the creation,
>
> Because they are not the noblesse of the nation.
>
> The gentry have Committees, and rely
>
> That they subscribers rank and merit try;
>
> To see no citizen or tradesman pass,
>
> To join and horrify the privileged class —
>
> To be secure, their orders run thus far,
>
> To let none in eastward of Temple Bar.
>
> Bel. There's many citizens of sense and worth,
>
> Who far exceed these gentry of high birth:
>
> There's instances in plenty I could state,
>
> Of poor, but titled, blocks in church and state.
>
> Jem. True, true, I did but generally allude

> That these nice gentry all cits exclude;
>
> They think a trader far below their station,
>
> Whom to make free with, would be degradation.
>
> Exceptions certainly are sometimes made,
>
> For those who've made great fortunes by their trade;
>
> As our nobility, I can't deny,
>
> Do sometimes to rich citizens apply
>
> For what they call a "temporary supply".
>
> And for these favours sometimes lay aside
>
> Those nice distinctions of patrician pride.

> A Scavan[[The late mister Belzoni, the enterprising traveller, after his return from Egypt, visited a grand subscription ball at the King's Theatre, London, (professedly held for the relief of the distressed people of Ireland) an attempt was made to expel him, although he had fairly purchased a ticket (as he was not one of the privileged class) — the circumstance may be, perhaps, in the recollection of some readers. From what transpired at the time, it appeared there had been some clandestine dealings in tickets, which were sent to Shops for sale. No imputation could attach to mister B. whose conduct in the transaction was open and honourable. Whether as much should be said of some of the directors, the public will form their opinion.]], though he half the world had seen,

### [[Located in footnote in original]]A Country Dance

As it is named, (or more properly an English country dance) almost universally known as the national dance of English, is constructed on mathematical principles, clearly displayed in its operative effect, when properly and well performed. It is formed of two principal features, videlicet figures and steps, which, for the execution, government and display of their several movements and evolutions, are united with their indispensable auxiliary, music: but independent of the scientific structure of the dance, there are secondary features, named ornaments and embellishments, and which are necessary to the performance of the figures and steps to the music, as they apply and are connected with each other in a graceful and easy manner. The figures, which form various evolutionary movements in circular, serpentine, angular, and straight lines, are formed into a variety of different lengths, (as shown by the diagrams in the complete system of English country dancing) and require a variety of different steps or movements of the feet in their performance to music appropriately adapted thereto. A country dance is formed of an indefinite number of ladies and gentlemen, not less than six. The ladies and gentlemen are placed in two rows of lines parallel with each other; the one consisting of ladies, which is called the ladies' side; and the other of gentlemen; which is called the gentlemen's side; every lady is opposite a gentleman, who are called partners. The couples being so placed, form which is termed "a set", and are demonstrated by different technical appellations, according to their situations, or the manner in which they are employed in the dance. The subjoined sketch will more clearly elucidate the form and construction of an English country dance, as formed into various sets, as Set A, Set B, Set C; also the formation of the major and minor sets, of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd or top, central, and bottom couples; likewise the leading, neutral and auxiliary couples, top and bottom of the set, &c.

*Figure omitted*

### Explanation of the Diagrams and Characters Contained in the Above Form and Construction of a Country Dance
* Leading set is that set, however many there may be, which is privileged to call the first dance, and is generally called the first set, of Set A, see figure 1 and the article "Sets and divisions of the dance".
* Minor set; any three couples in the general set performing the figure within themselves is termed "Minor set"; how these sets are formed and the number every dance will admit of, may be seen by the diagrams and article "Minor set".
* Ladies and gentlemen's side, is shown in the 1st of the Set A, and is known by, the ladies always having the top of the room or set on their right hand, and the gentlemen on their left.
* Across the dance, means across the set.
* Top of the dance or set, is from whence the dancing commences (see the form and construction of a country dance), and is on the right hand of the ladies, and on the left of the gentlemen. Should the room be square, instead of placing 3 sets parallel with each other, 4 sets might be formed, as shown at figure 12.
* Top couple is the same as first couple; there are the top couple in general and in the minor set, see the article "Minor set".
* Auxiliary couples are those that assist the leading couple in the performance of the dance, they are active and inactive; see diagram 3 and 10, and the article "Auxiliary couples".
* Lady and gentleman: when the appellations of lady and gentleman are made use of in a minor set, the leading couple (whether at top, centre and bottom), is meant, if no other lady or gentleman are otherwise particularly alluded to.
* Neutral couple, is an inactive couple not required in the performance of the figure; they generally divide the minor set, but are sometimes included in it. See Figures 1 and 4 and the article "Neutral couple".
* Central couple; when the leading couple is acting in the centre of a minor set, it is called the central couple, that title never belongs to the second couple: see "Minor set".
* Whole figure, is a figure that is whole, perfect and indivisible, beginning and ending in the same place; see diagram 10 and the article "Whole figures".
* Down the middle, is a movement made between the couples, in the direction of from top to bottom; see figure 2.
* The set: when a number of ladies and gentlemen, their partners, stand opposite each other in two parallel lines, in dancing order, whey a called a set, as shown in the plan of a country dance, and in the article "Sets and divisions of the dance".
* Set or setting, dancing in one place; frequently called foot or footing.

### Sets or Divisions of the Dance

A country dance is formed into different sets or divisions when the company are too numerous for one set, not only that a greater variety of calls may be had, but also to prevent the fatigue occasioned by the too great length of the set, a set containing in length, or in one line,thirty or forty couples may be divided into two sets, by placing a form or drawing line across the middle of the set.

The following diagram is the form and construction of a country dance, composed of two sets, formed in one straight line or row.

*Figure omitted*

When the width of the room will admit, and the company are sufficiently numerous, they may be divided into different divisions and placed in parallel lines, at a convenient distance from each other, having respectively the top of the set at the same end or part of the room: they may be distinguished from each other by numerical figures or letters, as Set 1 or Set A, Set 2 or Set B, &c. Notwithstanding that that they all branch from Set 1 or Set A, and are properly but a continuation of that set formed into divisions according to room, yet they have their respective privileges respecting the "calls". Set 1 or A call the first dance, Set 2 or B the second, Set 3 of 3 the third, &c. Should there be no more than three sets, after the call of Set 3 or C, the call goes back to Set 1 or A, and No. 2 in that set call the fourth dance; then No. 2 in Set 2 or B the fifth dance, &c. Whatever dance is called, and in which ever set it may be, the other sets are governed by it respecting tune and figures, thus: if Set C has the call, Sets A and B must consult them respecting the figure, and perform it precisely in the same manner; any alteration or deviation being considered as a mark of disrespect to the lady who calls the dance. The manner of forming this sets or divisions may be seen by "The construction of a country dance", p. 159. In forming them, they must be divided as equally as possible with respect to the number of couples, that the respective sets may finish the dance as nearly as possible at the same time. The ladies being each furnished with a ticket, bearing the name of the set to which they belong, with the number thereon inscribed according to their situation in the dance, as A No. 1, B No. 2, &c.: should place them in a conspicuous part of their dress to prevent disputes respecting places, (videlicet the "Etiquette of the ball room", in "The complete system of English country dancing"). It frequently occurs, that gentlemen's side, which ought to be avoided (except where there are not an equal number of ladies and gentlemen present) as it destroys the appearance of the construction of the dance, and tends to produce mistakes in the performance of the figures, particularly with those persons not thoroughly acquainted with the figure of the dance.

### Distance of Standing

The proper distance of the lines formed by the ladies and gentlemen from each other is about four feet and a half, and the distance of the respective couples from each other is about two feet and a half. The proper distance and the keeping of the lines truly parallel is necessary to the correct performance of the figures, every person in the set having thereby an opportunity of seeing the various evolutions of the figure performed by the leading couples, which very frequently proves of the greatest utility to those persons in the dance unacquainted with the figures, and prevents the confusion that would otherwise occur. Should the company be numerous, or the room not of sufficient length to admit the whole of the persons to stand up in one set, they may be arranged and formed according to the width of the room into other sets parallel with each other (ride "Construction of the country dance", and the article "Division of sets"), and numbered in succession, Set 1, Set 2, &c.; or distinguished by letters as Set A, Set B, &c. These divisions may be considered as the parts of first set, being properly a continuation of that set, formed into divisions for the sake of convenience. In performing the dance, the couples, by changing situations, lose the original name or character attached to them, and acquire another, according to the situation they become placed in, or the operative principle of the dance. The technical names of characters attached to the respective couples occur in every country dance, and are permanent in certain situations, and the names of many of the figures are derived from them. The learner must therefore understand them ere he can be supposed properly to connect and apply them in the formation of a country dance. The principal of them are the "minor set", the "leading couple", the "neutral couple", the "auxiliary couples", the "top", "bottom", and "central couples", or "first", "second", and "third couples".

### The Minor Set

Is formed of three couples, which is sufficient for the performance of any country dance figure constituting in themselves a perfect set, so that every three couples in a general set performing a figure within themselves, is properly termed a minor set, having a top, bottom and central couple, enabling them to perform every figure from every given situation in the dance; the minor set is formed and varied by the progressive motion of the dance, and are more or less numerous, according to the number of persons composing the dance; for instance, a general set consisting of twenty-four couples (the dance being in full action) will have (when the fourth, or couple below the minor set is the neutral couple, as seen at figure 1) six minor sets; if the neutral couple is included in the minor set (as in figure 7), then there will be eight minor sets in a dance of twenty-four couples. Minor sets may be formed in any part of the general set, where it shall occur that the leading or top couple of the minor set have two couples below; videlicet a second and a third couple to act with them or where the leading couple are performing a figure in the centre; in which case, the couples forming the minor set are differently termed, the leading couple being called the central; the third the bottom; and the couple who stand second at the commencement of the figure will then be the first or top couple (see figure 5 in "The construction of a county dance"), thereby losing their original names or characters, immediately the leading couple perform the progressive figure. When first, second, and third couples, or top, centre, and bottom, are mentioned, the dancer should be acquainted as to which of two they should belong (the general or minor set) or he will be otherwise misled. In the general set, the numerical order is regulated accordingly as they are given out at the calling up of the dance; and top and bottom only relate to the top and bottom couple of the dance or general set. When the leading couple is at the top, the second couple is properly the central couple (yet it never assumes that name), being reserved for the leading couple, when they in the performance of the figure occupy the place of the second couple, who consequently become the top couple, and therefore, when the central couple is named, the leading couple alluded to are acting in the centre. The third couple become the bottom couple, immediately on the leading couple becoming the central one, and perform any figure or figures required from that situation; the minor set thereby have no nominal central couple. Such are those that finish the figure with a progressive one, and have no figure performed from the centre by the leading couple.

### Leading Couple

Is the couple going down the dance; and there will be as many leading couples as minor sets in a dance, so that a dance of sixty couples would have twenty leading couples, the dance being in full activity.

### Auxiliary Couples

Are those couples in a minor that that assist the leading couple in the performance of the figures, either actively or inactively. Some minor sets contain one, others two; but no dance can be formed without one. Their numbers are governed by the direction of figures, and the couples they employ or require in their performance. When a dance contains but one auxiliary couple, it will be composed of figures that in their performance require and employ the leading and the second couple only, or contain a neutral couple within the minor set, hence the second couple becomes the auxiliary couple, whether active or inactive: and every dance containing a figure or figures employing a whole minor set, or by any means connecting themselves with the bottom or third couples, and the neutral couple being the fourth or couple below, the minor set will have two auxiliary couples, active or inactive, according the the nature of the figures. There are some individual figures, that in their performance do no require an auxiliary couple, such as "allemande", "turn your partner", &c.; but every dance must contain one at least as no dance can be performed without a progressive figure, requiring for its performance the second couple. The third couple may be an auxiliary one at one part of the figure, and not at another; but whenever it is employed or required, it is considered as belonging to the dance, the second couple being always auxiliary.

### Active Auxiliary Couples

Are those couples that actively assist the leading couple in the performance of the figures, as "right and left", "set and change sides", – "hey", – "hands six round", where the figure of the dance cannot be performed without the active assistance of the other couple or couples; for were they to remain stationary, the figure could not be completely performed. A dance may contain either one or two, or be composed of inactive auxiliary couples, according to the nature of the figures of which it may be composed (see "The complete system of English country dancing", where it is shown how the figures employ the couples, and where they begin and end). In "Sir David hunter blair" single figure, there will be one active auxiliary couple, which will be in "set and hands across and back again" (videlicet "Companion to the ball-room"). In "Nancy Dawson" there will be two active auxiliary couples employs in the figure "hey".

### Inactive Auxiliary Couples

Are those couples which, although auxiliary couples, and required in the performance of the figure, yet remain wholly stationary and inactive; as in "whole figure at top", – "cast off two couple", – "whole figure on your own sides", – "lead through top and bottom", &c. A dance may contain either one or two, or be composed wholly of active figures, according to the selection. In "the Campbell's are coming", single figure (see "Companion to the ball-room") but one auxiliary couple is required (which is inactive) that is used in the performance of the progressive figure, which employ only the leading couple. In the "Rakish highlandman", (single figure) there are two inactive auxiliary couples.

### Neutral Couple

A neutral couple is an inactive couple, not required in the figure, and one that divides the minor sets, by its being the fourth or couple below a minor set; yet it is sometimes the third or bottom couple of and included in the minor set, and is constituted, by affording space, to prevent confusion in the dance, too frequently occasioned by the figures interfering and becoming entangled with each other. Those are neutral couples to which no figure extends. When the dance is in full activity, the number of neutral couples will be in proportion to the number of minor sets contained therein, whether included in the minor set or below it. A dance consisting of thirty couples, the neutral couples included in the minor set will contain ten neutral couples, but if the neutral couple be the fourth, or couple below the minor set, then the dance will contain but seven minor sets, with seven neutral couples attached to them additionally (videlicet "The construction of a country dance"). Every minor set must have a neutral couple either included in it, or attached to it. When the neutral couple is included in the minor set, it is always formed of the third or bottom couple. The constituting of the neutral couple depends entirely on the figures employed in the dance, as all those figures which employ the whole of the minor set constitute the fourth or couple below it; the neutral couple (See "The construction of a country dance", figures 1 & 9). In the performance of "Speed the plough" (see "Companion to the ball-room") either single or double figure, the fourth or couple below the minor set would be the neutral one; the whole of the minor set being employed in one of the figures. In the "Haunter tower", single figure, the neutral couple is included in the minor set, as the figure only employs two couple out of the minor set. The above examples, it is trusted, will be found sufficient.

### Motion and Progression of the Dance

The dance being constructed, the figure set, &c., the music properly adapted there to must be selected and played to put the dance in motion; the action and progressive motion in the performance of the dance must be understood, in order that every person in it may move progressively towards the bottom and the top regularly, that equal opportunity may be afforded to each to perform their respective parts. The top couple of the general set commence the dance, and after performing the various figures set to the same tune, finish a couple nearer the bottom; and the second will by moving up, become the top couple. The dance commences again, and the leading couple each time the figure is repeated, will progressively gain a couple towards the bottom, and will repeat or perform the figure at many times, as there are couples standing up in the set, not being permitted to gain more that one couple towards the bottom each time they finish the figure, but obliged to gain one couple to preserve the progressive motion of the dance. The progressing movement does not alone belong to the leading couple, but to all persons composing the dance, either moving a couple up or down as all the couples going down the dance progressively gain a couple towards the bottom every time the figure is performed, and all the other couples forming the set will at the same time progressively move up a couple towards the top of the dance, so that the whole of the couples in the set change this situation every time the figure is performed. As soon as the top couple cat form a minor set, that is, as soon as the leading couple or couples going down the dance have gone down three couples, or performed the figure three ties, then the couple left at the top of the general set, or of any minor set, must commence. When it relates to the general set, only then each couple will, according as they stand in rotation in the dance, become successively the top couple, and so on till all the couples forming the set have in succession (what is termed) "gone down the dance", and the couple that stood at the bottom at the beginning of the dance, has progressively "worked up" to the top, and afterwards gone down three couple; that the couple called the dance begin again, and go down within three couples of the bottom, which will finish the dance. The couple that called the dance stand at the bottom for the next dance.

### Country Dance Figures

Are of different form and length, and take the dancer in various directions (shown by the diagrams in "The complete system of English country dancing"), before they can be of use in the systematic composition of a dance, the length of all the individual figures must be shown, and their application to the music, and also the different between long and short figures.

### Long and Short Figures

For the convenience of the dancer in the application of the figures to the music, and for setting country dance figures, all the different figures, as fas as regards their length, are brought under two heads, "long" and "short figures"; of which there are several qualities enumerated and treated on under their respective heads.

### Long Figures

Are so named, from their requiring to their performance a strain of music of eight bars, which is the longest that should be used in English country dances (videlicet the article "Strains"): they are the longest also that can be applied to the use of the tables for the systematic composition of figures. Long figures are adapted for different uses in the dance, and receive additional names from the different situations in which they are performed in the dance; shown in "The complete system of English country dancing" in the article long figures, performed at top, in the centre, and at bottom of any minor set and long progressive figures. They are as nearly as possible of the same length, and occupy the same time in their performance, whether wholly composed of figure or movement, or whether a post consists of "setting", as, for instance, "hey on your sides" consists entirely of figure movement; and "set and change sides" of half figure and half setting, yet both are performed in the same time. When a dance is wholly composed of long figures, a figure is required to each strain of eight bars, as a tune of three strains with eight bar each, would require three long figures, either with or without setting, as may best suit the nature of the dance, or the taste of the company. Where the figures in this list to which setting is attached as "set and change sides" – "set and half right and left", &c. to be performed without setting, they would require but one half or four bars of the music for their performance, and would then be constituted short figures. Hence arises the impropriety of performing them without setting. While and long figures are deemed the same, though they widely differ from each other (videlicet whole figures). The following are a list of the principle long figures used in English country dancing: as

* Swing corners
* Turn corners
* Set contrary corners
* Lead outsides
* Lead through bottom and top
* Hands six round
* Promenade third couple
* Whole poussette
* Set and change sides and back
* Set and change places and back again
* Set and half right and left and back again
* Round bottom and up
* Round top and bottom
* The hey
* Set three across, and set three in your places
* Cast of two couple, and back again
* Cast over two couple
* Whole figure at top
* Whole figure at bottom
* While figure on your on side
* Chase round two couple
* Chain figure six round
* The three ladies and three gentlemen lead through and back again
* Swing with right hands round the second couple, and back again
* Swing with right hands round two couple
* The first lady turns the second gentleman, the 1st gentleman turns the second lady
* Hands three round with second lady, hands three with second gentleman
* Top lady sets between the second and third ladies
* Hands three round with second lady, who passes under to her place
* Hands three with second gentleman, who passes under to his place
* The double triangle
* The first lady leads down the second gentleman, the first gentleman leads down the second lady
* Lead down the middle and up again, this figure though in reality a short one, has been latterly (by the practice of galloping down a dozen couple, instead of confining its performance to three, the proper limits of every figure in English country dancing) made to require eight bars to its performance instead of four, and consequently converted into a long figure. It will, however, be given in the list of short figures to which class it properly belongs; the foregoing are the principle old country dance figures.

There are some few others, also a variety of new figures composed by the author, and shown by diagrams in "The complete system of English country dancing".

### Double Long Figures

This class of figures receive their name from their being double or twice the length of those called long figures; as "the three ladies lead round the three gentlemen", and "the thee gentlemen lead round the three ladies"; they require twice the length of music in their performance, videlicet: a stain of eight bars repeated, or two strains played straight through, as they cannot be divided. Some of them require setting, and some are progressive as may be seen by the diagrams in "The system of English country dancing", where their use and applications to the dance are shown.

### Short Figures

Are as nearly as possible one half of the length of the long figures, and require to their performance four bars of the music; the half figures are of the same length, but used differently. The names of the principle short figures are given in the following list in which the half figures are included. The manner in which they are used, and the direction they take in the dance may be seen by the diagrams and classes of figures for the use of the tables for composing country dances, in "The complete system of English country dancing". When these figures are applied, two are substituted for a long one, which are frequently applied to give variety and complexity to the dance. Short and half figures were formerly very much used in the composition of dances. In the old dance books many dances are composed wholly or nearly so, of short and half figures, to render the dances complex and difficult in their performance. These figures may be applied either at the top, bottom, or in the centre, of a minor set. Short figures, although only half the length of long figures, are perfect (with the exception of short progressive figures) ending where they begin, and have no setting attached to them. Some "half figures" have setting attached to them; and in this respect differ from short figures (videlicet "Half figures"). A dance may be composed wholly of short figures videlicet the dance entitled the "Caledonian rant", contained in the "Companion to the ball room", composed of four short figures. Formerly, when proper steps were not generally applied to the performance of the figure, it was the custom to divide and sub-divide figures; but to ender them systematically applicable to the strains of country dance music, only one division has been made; this the long or whole figures require a strain of eight bars; and the short or half require only four bars, or half a strain. The following list is a list of the principle short figures: as,

* Allemande
* Right and left
* Turn your partner
* Hands four round
* Half poussette
* Swing round your partner
* Lead through the bottom
* Lead through the top
* Cross over one couple
* Round the bottom
* Round the top
* Hands across half round
* Lead down the middle and up again
* Swing round one couple
* Cast off one couple
* The three gentlemen turn the three ladies
* And chase round one couple.

### Whole Figures

The terms "whole" and "long figures" are generally confused with each other, having been considered as the same; though they have quire a different meaning, there being short whole figures, and long whole figures. The term "whole figure" does not relate to the length of the figure so names, but to their being themselves finished, perfect, and indivisible, beginning and ending in the same place. These figures are of different length: "whole figure at top" requires double the music for its performance to either "allemande" or "turn your partner"; yet they are all whole figures. The last-mentioned figures are always arranged in the class of short figures; although they might be termed while figures, as they are perfect in themselves. Head a great many of the short figures been classed with those under the head long figures (except the progressive ones which are an exception to this rile, as they should always be considered as long and short, not ending where they begin, although "whole", and "half poussette" hear a different name), they might together have been termed "whole figures". To prevent as much as possible any confusion calculated to mislead the dancer, and the different figures are separated in "The Complete System of English Country Dancing".

### Half Figures

Are portions of certain long or whole figures divided into halves, and followed by a different figure, instead of completing the long or whole figure, and are therefore names "half figures". Those long figures are taken,and generally termed whole figures, and may be danced as "whole or perfect figures", or divided into half figures, at the pleasure of the dancer; there being whole figures at top, bottom, on your own sides, and half figures, bearing the same names formed out of them: they are generally applied to five variety and complexity to the dance in their performance; as they leave the dancer on the wrong side, they must be followed by some other half or short figure to bring the dancers back again to their own sides; but their uses are fully explained in the class of irregular figures to which they belong (in "The complete system of English country dancing"). The same time is required in their performance as in the short figures, videlicet a strain of short measure unrepeated, or half a strain of eight bars.

### Progressive Figures

Are those figures which in their performance leave the dancers or leading couples in the second couples place, every time the figure of the dance is finished; see the plate of the "Progressive motion of a country dance" in "The system of English country dancing",and the article "Motion and progression of the dance". They derived their names from the progressive movement towards the bottom of the dance, by bringing the top or leading couple in the place of the second couples every time one of these figures is performed in any minor set, and which progressive movement of the top or leading couple bring the second couple into, or to occupy the place of the top couple. Thus it will be seen that every dance must have at least one progressive figure to take each couple in regular succession to the bottom of the dance, to enable the couples placed at the bottom gradually to move up the couple that commenced it, although one progressive figure is sufficient for the correct performance of any English country dance, yet dances may be composed of two or even three progressive figures (see "The complete system of English country dancing", p. 232), though it very rarely occurs that more than one figure of this description is used. These are a very indispensable class of figures, as no dance can be performed without one, either short or long. They are always performed from or at the top of a minor set, but never bring the dancer back to the place from which they are taken – they are therefore called progressive figures, their performance bringing the top couple progressively to the bottom of the dance by gaining a couple every time the figure is performed; thus in a set of twenty couples, nineteen progressive figures must be performed to bring every top couple in the general set to the bottom of the dance. There are fewer progressive figures that of any other class; the following progressive figures, they are as follows:

* Swing with right hands round second couple, then with left
* Swing with right hands top and centre
* Lead down the middle and up again
* Whole poussette
* Swing round one couple
* Cast off one couple
* Set and change places with second couple

The length of these figures, and the directions they make in the dance may be seen in "The complete system of English country dancing", by the diagrams and classes of figures for the use of the tables.

### Irregular Figures

Are those figures that in their application to the dance either leave the performer on the wrong or opposite side, or below the third or bottom couple of a minor set. They are of different length: some have setting attached to them, and some are progressive figures; their length, uses, and properties are explained in "The complete system of English country dancing",

### Figures with Setting Attached to them

Those figures to which setting is attached, derive their name partly from the movement, and partly from the setting, the setting is generally mentioned first: as "set and change sides" – "set contrary corners" – "set and half right an left", &c. The figure employs but half the time allowed in the music, and the setting the other half.

### Of Joining or Connecting Figures

The uses, names, and characters used, and relative to a minor set, and the method of performing each individual figure, with their length, &c. as applied to the different parts of the dance and to the music, being known to the learner, he will be able to join and connect figures together so as to form a dance. The smallest number of figures that can be employed in the formation of a dance is two. The quantity of figures either in length or number, depends on the music to which they are set; the number of figures is governed by the number of bars or stains of the music (videlicet the scheme  showing the number of figures that may be set to any tune adapted to country dancing, videlicet p. 178). Single or double figures depend on whether the strains of the music are played once or repeated, and how many times repeated, videlicet p. 177. Treble figures may be set by repeating the strains or by playing them straight through. When short or half figures are set to strains of eight bars long measure, great attention must be paid to the playing of the music, two being required to one strain, one of which must end and the other begin in the middle of the strain; and frequently where there is little or no accent in the music to guide the dancer; the time  must however be kept, and the figures joined together on the proper note, without any hesitation or innovation on the time. Short measure (that is strain of four bars repeated) is better adapted to short or half figures, as the figures end with the strain. A perfect knowledge must be had of the beginning and ending of every strain, and their number, to enable the learner properly to begin, end, and join figures in time and place, also of what figures every dance requires, or will admit of, either long or short, and how to blend them together, so as to produce either short or easy, long or complex, single or double figures, to suit trait own taste, or to accommodate the talent of the company. There is no resting in the dance for the leading couple, till they get to the bottom, and the music is the only guide for the beginning and ending of every individual figure, as well as to the figure of the dance; however great a number of individual figures it may contain, they must all be united and connected together, so as to lose the appearance of many parts being connected, and product that of one true mathematical figure. A knowledge of the steps and their divisions, applicable to the music, is also necessary to be known and attended to.

### Long and Short Measure

Are terms the author has adopted to regulate the length of the strains, as applying to English country dance music, in order to ascertain whet quantity of music is contained in each strain or tune, as to length and number of bars; the whole of the tunes applicable to English country dancing, according to the present system, are brought under two heads, long and short measure, the long containing eight full bars of music, the short containing but four full bars of music; stains have been thus regulated, in order to render them systematically applicable to the various classes of figures, which are also classed and divided into suitable lengths, to correspond with those measures, and which when well understood, will enable the dancer with a knowledge of the number and repetitions of the strains, and with the use of the tables, in "The system of English country dancing" not only to ascertain correctly how many figures any dance will require, but of what length, quality, and different variety dances may be composed; also to ascertain how many figures long or short any dance may contain. See the article entitled "The number of figures possible to be set to any country dance tune".

### The Figure Bar

The figure bar marked thus <span class="next_img_size_1em"></span>![](/images/tr/wilson_04_down.svg), or thus <span class="next_img_size_1em"></span>![](/images/tr/wilson_16.svg), is used to divide one part of a figure from the rest, and to point out to the dancer how much figure is to be performed to each strain of the music, first having but one dot, denotes, that the strain belonging to that part of the figure to which it is set is to be played but once; the second having two dots, shows the strains to be repeated or played twice. The figure or figures placed before each strain of the music to which the figure-bar refers.The first bar relates to the first strain, the second the the second strain, and so on to the rest. In order to point out the division of the figure and music more clearly,the author has in his own works, when da capo occurs in short measure, divided the figure, by placing a bar with a single dot at the end of the capo strain, besides that which would naturally occur at the end of the capo, as in "The haunted tower", and "La belle Catherine" (see "Companion to the ball room"), because it cannot be considered like the first, a strain repeated, being in reality two different strains. The dots to divide these strains are always placed at the top of the bar, those to all others, whether in long or short measure, are always placed under the bar.

### Figure of the Dance

Although every country dance is composed of a number of individual figures, which may consist of

* set and change sides,
* whole figure at top,
* lead down the middle, and up again,
* allemande,
* lead through the bottom,
* right and left at top,

&c. yet the whole movement united is called the figure of the dance. The number and length of the various individual figures depend on the length of the music, the smallest number is two, and the greatest number is sixteen. The scheme at page 178, will show what number of long or short figures can be used to all country dance tunes, of whatever length or measure.

### Stains or Parts

A strain is that part of an air terminator by a double bar, and usually consists in country dances, of four, eight, or sixteen single bars; sometimes it contains twelve bars. In cotillons, we find occasionally strains of six bars; but this latter strain is extremely unfit for a country dance figure. Country dance tunes usually consist of two strains, though they frequently called parts, by those who are unacquainted with music; as, for instance, by a tune of two parts, they mean one of two strains. Part are only the arrangement of some air for different instruments, as the horn part, the trumpet part, &c. and have no relation to strains whatever. In some airs, particularly Scottish, the last strain will frequently extend to sixteen bars in long measure; but in reality, it is only eight bars repeated, with a small alteration in the last, or two last bars of the last strain, which has been written thus, for the sake of variety in the composition. While the regularity of figure at present established is adhered to, eight bars is the greatest length to which any strain can with propriety be extended, as long figures require no more. Some strains, as have been mentioned before, contain sixteen bars, without a division, as the "Caledonian laddie" (see "Companion to the ball room"), for instance, which of course require two long figures; the author has therefore, throughout his works placed a bar with s single dot, showing the dancer the middle of the strain, to denote the quantity of figure necessary to be performed in the first eight bars, so dividing it for the convenience of the dancer, as if it were two strains of eight bar each. He has equally taken this precaution in short measure, when a strain of sixteen bars occurs, and where he considered the dancer required a guide, as much as in the article "Long measure". See the article "Long and short measure" in "The complete system of English country dancing".

### The Length of Strains Used in Country Dance Music

The length of strains in country dance music seems never to have been attended to, either by composers, dances, or those who set the figures to the tunes, not has any thing systematic ever been adopted for their regulation, this is one of the reasons why figures are so irregularly performed, ans so litter understood. Numberless tunes formerly used, may be found not only containing strains of various lengths, but consisting of an odd number of bars, these dances could only be performed by the introduction of such pantomimical absurdities, as were formerly introduces in the old country dances (see the ancient and original state and style of English country dancing in "The complete system of English country dancing". As no regular figures could be set to them with any certainty, notwithstanding country dancing has since become more regular, and tunes containing an odd number of bars have been rejected, yet there are frequently found tunes containing strains of a variety of lengths, better calculated to puzzle that direct the dancer, some are so long as to reader it difficult, during its performance to divide the tunes exactly in the middle, when there is no sensible accent or signal to guide the ear, until the terminations of the strain. Formerly some well-known country dances contained twelve, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty four, thirty two bars in a strain &c. Now since figures are systematically divided into different length and classes, it has been found requisite also to adopt suitable length and measures in the music, to make them correspond; as there, with regard to length, are reduced to two classes, as long and short figures, therefore the terms long and short measure, are terms the author has adopted in the music, to correspond with those figures. The irregular length of strains as the result of composers not being dancers themselves, in which case they would have seen the propriety of not extending their strains beyond eight bars, which would have rendered their compositions more useful to dancers, suitable to the figures, and convenient to musicians, by an uniform length of strains. All tunes not corresponding with these regular measures, should either be rejected, or if given, should be accompanied with suitable directions for their performance; the length of these strains in long or short measure, will be found under their respective heads, in "The complete system of English country dancing". There are some persons who imaging that a strain of country dance music consists uniformly of eight bars, that is incorrect, although it ought to be so to suit the figures, yes there are many to be found consisting of sixteen bars, and other of only found, for although they are generally the case formally, would totally exclude all single figures, from tines with eight bars in a strain in long measure, see next article, "Single and double figures".

### Single and Double Figures

Are terms used to express the quantity of figure required in a country dance; and these depend invariable on the respective air to which they are danced. A single figure us the smallest quantity of figure that can possible be selected in one portion (or according to the usual term, set) to the tune; single figures can only be performed to short measure repeated, or to strains of long measure not repeated. To constitute what is termed a double figure, several figures must be placed together equal to twice the number of quantity required for a single figure; and the music, to admit of a double figure, will require the strains of eight bars to be repeated, and the strains of four bars to be played twice through with repeats.

### The Number of Figures Possible to be Set to Any Country Dance Tune Either Long or Short

Every country dance is composed of several different figures, teen, the usual number are from three to eight; the following scheme will show what number of long and short figures can  possibly be set to all the country dance tunes, by which it will be also seen that every tune will take as many long, and twice as many short figures as there are strain in the music. The length of strains alluded to, are those of eight bars unrepeated, or if four bars repeated, which is the proper length for English country dances.

* Tunes of sixteen bars composed of two strains of eight bars each, with single figures, may have set to them two long figures, or one long and two short, of four short figures.
* Tunes with three strains or two strains, and da capo, with single figures, may have set to them three long figures, or two long figures and two short, or one long and four short, or six short figures,
* Tunes with four strains or thirty two bars with single figures, may have set to them four long figures, or three long and two short, or two long and four short, or one ling and six short, or eight short.
* Tunes of four strains of eight bars each repeated, with double figures, may have set to them four long figures, or three long figures and two short, or two long and two long and four short, or one long and six short, or eight short.
* Tunes of three strains repeated, or two strains and da capo played twice thought with double figures, may have set to them six long figures, or give long and two short, or four long an four short, or three long and six short, or two long and eight short, or one long and ten short, or twelve short figures.
* Tunes containing sixty four bars, composed of four strains repeated, or of three strains an da capo played twice straight through with double figures, may have set to them eight long figures, or seven long and two short, or six long and four short, or three long and ten short, or two long and twelve short, on one long and fourteen short, or sixteen short figures.
* Tunes of four strains and da capo with single figures, may have set to them five long figures, or four long figures and two short, or three long and four short, or two long and six short, or one long and eight short, or ten short figures.

### Country Dance Music

Country dances are performed to tunes of various length, divided into strains or parts, by upright double bars, thus ||, and when the strain is repeated, two dots are added thus :||:. These usual numbers being gour, eight, and sometimes sixteen bars, which is the greatest number, and sometimes for the sake of variety in the composition of the music, instead of repeating a strain of eight bars, the whole sixteen will be written straight through, this is sometimes done for the purpose of introducing a small alteration in the last, or two last bars, when this is the case, it generally occurs in the last strain of a tune, and may frequently be found in old Scotch tunes. A tune may sometimes be found to contain a strain with twelve bars, which measure is now seldom used. The strains in country dance tunes ought never to contain more that eight bars each, although, as has been before observed, sixteen bars are frequently written straight through, instead of repeating the strain of eight bars, and yet where this is the case, so near is it in reality to a repetition of eight bars, that with the exception of a few notes in the last, or two last bars, the music is note for note the same , and notwithstanding that many tunes are to be found particularly in the old country dance books, which contain a much greater number of bars in each strain, they must be never taken as authorities, as no dependence whatever can be placed in them, most of them having originally been songs, and introduced into country dance books, by persons totally unacquainted with the system of English country dancing. For a further elucidation of this subject, the the articles "Length of strains" and "Stains or parts".

### Da capo

When it occurs, signifies that the tine to which it is attached ends with the first strain, and is used as a reference to prevent the trouble of writing the strain again, and thus an air of two strains of eight bars each, that is in long measure, with da capo attached to it, consists really of three strains, and a tune of three strains and da capo is equal to four strains. In short measure it seldom makes any addition to the length of tune, as the first strain is usually played twice, the second but once, and then the da cope or first strains again, which together make but four short strains, which would be so without the da capo, as in the case the second strain would necessarily be repeated.

### Progressive Movements

Of "Lead down and up again", – "Whole poussette", – "Swing with the right hand round one couple", &c. when performed, attention to the music is necessary, as the couples must move up the the leading couple's place, as they progressively move down, to keep the proper distance between the couples, and give the leading couple room to perform the succeeding figures, or to commence the dance again.

### Of Selecting Figures, and Applying the to the Dance

In the selecting of figures for the composition of English country dances, it is necessary that a knowledge should be had of their various effects in the dance, notwithstanding that many of them are of the same length, and performed from the same situation, an though directed at or from the top, are yet not so well adapted to the commencement of the dance: it is the same with figures adapted to the conclusion of the dance. Care should be taken not to choose all such figures as bear too great a similarity in appearance to each other, either in form or effect, or such figures that only employ the leading couple (unless there be particular reason) the other couples being consequently unemployed, render it irksome to them, particularly if the set be numerous. One reason for their being introduced has been that the company generally being bad dancers, and not understanding figures, they have been chosen, to enable couple calling the dance to display their abilities; and by thus preventing confusion in the dance, have been in no danger of having their exclusive evolutions broken into, or spoiled, though the inability of others, they being little more that silent spectators. When a company consists of tolerably good dancers, they should be so united as to give activity and employment to the company, according to the length of the music. A dance ought not to be wholly composed of circular figures as they tend to excite giddiness in the dancers, and produce a sameness of appearance. When a dance is intended to be rendered difficult and complex, let it be composed principally of short or half figures, set to tunes in long measure; there being little or no accent in this measure for the direction of the joining of the figures. To enable good dancers to display their abilities, choose principally those figures, which bad dancers most fear, as they seldom have any steps properly adapted thereto. Slow music also tends to expose bad dancers. The most difficult figures for indifferent dancers to perform are

* right and left,
* set and half right and left,
* chain figure six round, and
* four round,
* swing right hand round one couple, then with the left,
* set contrary corners, &c. &c.

Therefore, when a dance is called to be performed amongst indifferent dancers, such figures ought to be avoided, to prevent confusion. Double, and even treble figures, should be practised by the learner; but not called, unless in companies of good dancers. In selecting the figures for a dance, it is not advisable to take too many from one class, or of those performed from one situation; but to take some from each, and give them as much variety as the length of the tune and the talent of the company will admit.

### Of the Performing Figures Within Their Proper Compass

As three couples constitute a country dance, as to number of persons, the figures are so composed as to be kept within their distance of standing. A great error, committed by many persons, particularly to be avoided, is, that a couple in "going down the middle", and in "cast off two couple", instead of confining themselves to the distance of three couple, frequently extend the figures beyond six couples, and consequently interfere with the preceding couples.

### Persons Calling the Dance

Should possess the necessary requisites for performing the duty they may have to execute, in setting the company an example, and dire ting them (when required) in the performance of the dance. Such a dance should be called, as they thoroughly understand, and are able to perform with facility. When part of the company are indifferent dancers, the persons forming the dance should be selected and placed according to their talent and knowledge of dancing; the best couples at and near the top, that by their performance the others may become instructed in the figure, previous to their having to lead off, otherwise it frequently happens, that the dance is obliged to be changed.

### Silence in the Dance

Should invariably be observed; but it too frequently occurs, that one half of the persons composing the dance are in conversations on subjects generally unconnected with the dance; their attention so frequently required, not only thereby becomes diverted, but the music, which is the guide for the dancer, is prevented from being distinctly heard.

### Crowding to the Top

Is too frequently practised, but should be prevented by those whose province it may be to see that due respect is paid to the person calling the dance; it being impossible to perform the figure of the dance with effect, or correctly, when the couples stand to near to each other.

### Attention to the Figure

While the figure is performing, it is requisite for every person in the dance to observe, whether any of the figures require their attention and assistance for their correct performance, and what number of couples they may require; otherwise, for want of proper attentions, part of the music becomes lost, and the music and figure cannot then be finished together without much bustle, as the music must not wait on the dancers, but the dancers perform the figures and steps as properly adapted thereto.

### Finishing the Figures in Their Proper Places

Whatever figure is performed, it should be finished in its proper place before another is commenced; the regularity of the dance must otherwise be completely destroyed. The progressive figures should be finished in the centre; and those at top, &c. that bring the dancer back to the same place, should finish in the straight line with the other couples, always observing to finish the figure with the last note of the music.

### Paradoxical Observations

For the purpose of blending amusement with instruction, and to facilitate the learner's acquirement of something more that a superficial knowledge of country dancing, as well as to convince those persons of the error who hold country dancing as simple trifling art, very easily attainable, the following positions are laid down, to show the nature, extent, and variety, of which country dancing consists, though to some persons, particularly to learners, they may appear paradoxical; yes they are self-evident truth, capable of being clearly explained by good dancers, and rendered easily demonstrable, by an attention to those parts of the work on country dancing, to which they more immediately relate.

> That when miss Frump comes in, no heed you'll take

### Enter Miss Frump and Jemima

> Miss Frump. Hey day! what have we music here? that's right,
>
> I am overjoyed; we'll have a dance to night.
>
> Jem. By all means aunt – for that I came to you;
>
> You now can help us out in something new.
>
> Miss Frump. I'll join in any thing, country dance or reel,
>
> Can beat my steps, with either toe or heel;
>
> Can run the hey – can figure out or in.
>
> Bel. It is growing late – Jemima, let's begin.
>
> Jem. You know its ball night, aunt, and ten to one,
>
> Had it not rained, before this weed begun.
>
> Miss Frump. My toes are itching to begin; now say
>
> What it shall be, and bid the music play.
>
> Jem. I should have told you aunt, that we propose
>
> To give some imitations, here of those
>
> New fangled dances, waltzes and quadrilles,
>
> And those queer modern dancing Jacks and Jills.
>
> Miss Frump. You may say Jacks and Jills, for such queer guests
>
> I never saw, as ball rooms now infest.
>
> If I could see them well exposed, it would be
>
> The greatest pleasure you could give to me;
>
> I shall be happy to make one, and show
>
> That I the antics of these gentry know.
>
> Bel. We'll now begin; here are miss Frump and I,
>
> Who will the leading couple now supply.
>
> Jem. Play the dance I mentioned, sirs, rather slow;
>
> Musicians. I fear miss, we that dance don't rightly know.
>
> Miss Frump (to Jemima). What is the true? Have you the music brought?
>
> Jem. It is you old favourite, aunt "The Merry Thought".
>
> Miss Frump. A charming tune "The Merry Thought" I love;
>
> If it's well played, ah! that will make you move.
>
> I'm for a merry tune; at our last ball,
>
> I[[Miss Frump, it will be observed, is not a polished dancer, she is supposed to have been taught in the ordinary style about forty or fifty years ago, when those dances she mentions were favorites in the Ball Room.]] "Buttered Peas" and "Jack's Alive" did call.
>
> Jem. If you don't recollect "The Merry Thought", now play
>
> The last new tune, called "Buxom, Young, and Gay".
>
> We're ready, sirs – three chords, and then begin;
>
> Come to your places, children – now stand in.
>
> Bel. Dance as you've just described them, then it will be
>
> Instruction and amusement both for me.
>
> Miss Frump. I'll show you how I have seen some sorry fops,
>
> Dance country dances, at your modern hops.

### They Dance

> Bel. This is just like them, and I wish these elves
>
> Could only see what fools they make themselves;
>
> Instead of country dancing, I am quite sure,
>
> Foreigners would call such stuff a caricature.
>
> Jem. To see them dance, it would never be supposed
>
> The dance was on true principles composed;
>
> So unlike mathematic rules they go,
>
> From what they do, a stranger scarce would know
>
> The middle or beginning, or intent
>
> Of those who dance, or what is really meant;
>
> And what's still more, the time they seldom keep,
>
> Some run the figures – others through them creep

### Quadrilles



> So slow, they lose the time; whilst those who run,
>
> Will end the figures here the tune's hand done.
>
> The music seems no guide, though all advance,
>
> Without good music they can never dance;
>
> They know not good from bad – quick tunes will please,
>
> They'd dance as well to warning pan and keys,
>
> With which old women mostly swarm their bees.
>
> Bel. Now for a quadrille, and let us straight proceed,
>
> My Aunt, miss Frump, and I, will take the lead;
>
> Play the first set sirs, the tunes you know,
>
> Not very quick, but sweetly moderato.
>
> Jem. Quadrilles are generally played so quick, not one
>
> In ten can dance the steps, they're forced to run.
>
> Without the music's played in time correct,
>
> And well in tune, with taste and some effect;
>
> Dancing can never please, be what it will,
>
> Waltzing, country dancing, or quadrille:

> Musicians should not bear quite all the blame,
>
> Composers to a portion have a claim;

> Simple melody; but all their art display,
>
> To make them cramp and difficult to play.
>
> Bel. There's many of them if played e'en so well,
>
> Will never please the ear, nor ever sell;
>
> For they forget, simplicity and ease
>
> In music, as in verse will always please.
>
> Jem. Quadrilles have lately so fast multiplied,
>
> That all the world from us may be supplied;
>
> The dancer makes quadrilles, as he supposes,
>
> And every crotched-monger now composes;
>
> Each on the town his own chef d'oeuvre imposes.
>
> Numbers we have – but numbers you well know,

> Too frequently but serve to make a show;
>
> Experience always quality prefers,
>
> And says one lion's worthfull twenty curs;
>
> That half the new quadrilles – I proof can bring,

> Examine them – they are as like each other,

[[Located in footnote in original]]There are several sets of what are termed "Scotch quadrilles", which are only Scotch as to name and tune, having no other national characteristic, being composed of French quadrille figures and steps. In order to enable those who are conversant with Scotch dancing, to judge how far these are entitled to the appellation of Scotch, the reader is here presented with the figures of

The following is a set of what the author terms "Scotch quadrilles", which are adapted to Scotch steps, and he submits them to the judgement of those, who are acquainted with the national characteristic – they are entitled

### The Royal Scotch Quadrilles

[[Located in footnote in original]]It frequently occurs when dancers call different sets of quadrilles, and the musicians play the original music to each set; the dancers for want of ability, perform the figures of the first set to all, and are seldom ashamed to boast of the several sets they have danced, and even to enumerate their names.

### The Original, or, Old First Set of French Quadrilles

1.	Le pantalon.

	Top an bottom couple right and left,

	Ladies chain,

	Half promenade, and

	The top lady and bottom gentleman advance and retire,

	Chassez to right and left, cross over,

	Chassez right and left,

	Return to places,

	Set and turn partners,

	The other three couples do the same.

3.	La poule.

	The top lady and opposite gentleman cross over on the right hand, and set,

	Back on the left, and

	Set four in line,

	Half promenade,

	The leading lady and opposite gentleman advance or retire and back to back,

	Top and bottom couples advance and retire, and half right and left to places,

	The other three couples do the same.

4.	Trenise.

	Ladies chain, with top and bottom ladies,

	Set and turn partners,

	First couple advance twice, leaving the lady on the left of the opposite gentleman,

[[Located in footnote in original]]The author was also the original inventor of that species denominated "Waltz quadrilles", from their combining the waltz with the quadrille figures, as he was likewise of the country dance quadrilles, so called from blending in a particular manner both these forms of dancing.

	### Long and Short Sets

	When these terms are used in quadrille dancing, they allude to the number of dances in the set; a long set generally consists of six, and a short set is usually of five. The first is considered a short set, and when la pastourelle is add, it is then termed a long set. A short set consists not only of a smaller number of quadrilles, but various figures are omitted in certain quadrilles, as the ladies chain in Trenise, and the finale, is likewise abridged.

[[Located in footnote in original]]That this practice has become too prevalent, the Author, as well as many others, considers he has some reason to complain he some time ago composed a dance to the tune of Vestris's gavotte, to be danced as a quadrille, though not strictly so; this dance, which became a favorite, is not that which, under a similar title, is included in a "Quadrille Preceptor", though he has reason to believe the latter dance was intended to be given as the original; whether that were so or not, wishing only to have the fruit of his own labours, and to derive no credit from the merits of others, he here presents a correct copy of the one composed by himself.

### The Gavotte Quadrille

The honours to first strain of minuet de la cour.

The top and bottom couples set opposite to each other à la gavotte – eight bars.

Side couples do the same – eight bars.

Set to partners, giving the right and left hands alternately, and go round your partners on the right to places – twelve bars.

Each gentleman gives his right hand to the lady on the left, and his left alternately to his partner, then pass round with the lady on the right – twelve bars.

Top and bottom couples advance twice with pas de basque, and retire with emboitées – eight bars.

The side couples do the same – eight bars.

Top and bottom ladies advance round each other à la gavotte – twelve bars.

The ladies on the sides do the same - twelve bars.

Top and bottom couples set opposite each other as in figure 1, while the side couples chassez croissez – eight bars.

Vice versa – eight bars.

Pas de quatre four ladies – twelve bars.

Each gentleman takes his partner's left hand and moves completely round to places with grand balloté; jetée back, and coupée entrechat à la fin.

The author of this work will always feel it is duty to expose and reprobate all mean attempts al literary piracy and plagiarism, whether affecting his own compositions or those of others.

	### Waiting Eight Bars

	The set being formed, the dancers should wait the first eight bars, and begin the dance with the second strains, if the first is not repeated, this interval of time should be filled up with the performances of the honours. To every quadrille in the set they should wait the first eight bars.

	### The Honours (i. e.) the Bow and Courtesy

	In quadrille dancing these honours should always be made to your partner and the opposite, and to the first eight bars if music, before you begin the figure. The honours should not only be made at the commencement of each set, but likewise of each individual quadrilles, however many there may be in a set, and also at the conclusion of every set, and finally by every gentleman when he has led his partner to her seat.

### [[Located in footnote in original]]Positions of the Dancers in Quadrilles Composed of Four, Eight, Twelve, and Sixteen Persons

*Figure omitted*

Some teachers call the bottom the second couple, and the couple on the right of the leading couple, the third couple, but the usual method is to reckon numerically round on the right of the top couple, as shown in the diagram for eight persons.

### Direction for Performing the Quadrilles

In sets composed of eight persons (see figure 1) the first and third couples generally dance together, as do the sends and fourth. When the figure begins with two persons, as in l'été, is it performed with the first lady and third gentleman, then with the first gentleman and third lady, then the second lady and fourth gentleman, and is finished with the second gentleman and fourth lady. In a quadrille of twelve (see figure 2) when the first and fourth couple have performed the danse... _Text incomplete here_.
