M!!ADAM!!,
 
THE Work I here presume to offer 
your _Ladyship_, treating of a Subject 
in which you are not only well ver[-]
sed, but even excel; it was natural and obvi[-]
ous {Page} for me to _dedicate_ it to you, confiding 
that, under so honourable a Protection, it 
may at least be skreen'd from such unjust Cen[-]
sures as Malice or Envy ordinarily produce.
 
I!!T!! may perhaps be expected that I should say 
something of the Nobility and great Endow[-]
ments of your Ancestors, as is usually done 
in _Dedicatory Epistles_; but the World is so well 
acquainted with your L!!ADYSHIP'S!! illustrious 
Families, both that from which you came as 
well as that to which you are happily ally'd, 
that to mention any thing of them would ra[-]
ther be derogating from their Praise, seeing all 
I could relate would be inferior, both to 
their Merit and to the Opinion of all those 
who know them. All that I will venture to say 
is, that your Candour, Affability, Sweetness 
and Charity, join'd to all your other great 
Qualities, give as great a Lustre to your Fami[-]
ly, as what you receive from it.

{Page} B!!UT!! of all your Perfections what touches 
me the most, is your great Talent in the A!!RT!! 
of D!!ANCING!!, which I can speak the more free[-]
ly of, as I was not only a Spectator, but had 
the Honour to contribute to, for some Time: 
Not that I pretend to arrogate to myself the 
Glory of the great Proficiency you made (for 
that was wholly due to your natural Genius 
for that Science) but only think myself hap[-]
py in having had the good Fortune to give Les[-]
sons to a L!!ADY!! that perform'd in a Manner no 
less elegant than uncommon.

N!!OR!! do I so much wonder at the Progress 
your L!!ADYSHIP!! made in this Science, when 
I consider your wonderful Genius and ex[-]
quisite Taste for _Music_, which is one of the 
greatest Helps to a perfect Performance in 
D!!ANCING!!. All these rare Talents give me a
{Page} greater Title to your L!!ADYSHIP'S!! gracious Ac[-]
ceptance of this Work; at least it gives me an 
Occasion of assuring you how much I am, with 
all Respect and Esteem,

>> M!!ADAM!!,

>> _Your_ L!!ADYSHIP'S!!

>> _most obedient, and_

>> _most humble Servant,_

### {Page} THE
    PREFACE.

I _Now at last have the Pleasure of presenting to the World a Work, 
which has been long promised; but which, through the Difficulty 
of the Undertaking itself, and the many Obstacles to the Execution 
of it, I was not able to finish before._

_This Undertaking must needs have been attended with great Diffi[-]
culty, because it was really the first of the Kind. For tho' Mon[-]
sieur Beauchamp lay'd the first Foundation, upon which Monsieur_ Feu[-]
illet _built, (as some more ingenious Person may perhaps improve upon 
mine); yet the Works of both relate only to the Characters of 
Dancing; which, like the Notes of Music, can be only useful to Ma[-]
sters, and cannot be understood by any other without their particular 
Instructions. But the Piece which I here offer to the World will be 
of general Use to all, who either have learned, or are learning to dance: 
the Words describing the Manner in which the Steps are to be taken; 
and the Figures representing Persons as actually taking them; both 
which together will make the Learning more pleasant to the one, and 
serve as a continual Remembrancer to the other._

_As most other Arts and Sciences, reduced to certain Rules, have 
been now long since taught in Books, I have often wondered no one 
should have hitherto paid the same Regard to the_ Art of Dancing. 
_This is what I have endeavoured to do in the following Work: 
wherein I have not pretended to advance any new Laws for Dancing 
unknown before; but only to collect and submit to view those Princi[-]
ples and Rules, which I had seen taught with the greatest Success 
{Page} by the most eminent Masters in the genteel Way. As the Notes of 
the Music are placed on the Top of every Plate, the Characters of 
the Steps marked below, and the Figures represent two Persons in the 
very Action of Dancing; whoever has made any Progress in the 
Knowledge of musical Notes and of the Characters of Dancing, will be 
able by intently viewing one of these Plates, at one and at the same Time, 
to call to Mind the Tune, to know the Order of the Steps, and to put 
the Body into the proper Attitude to take them. And tho' this Book, 
like all others which treat of any Art or Science, cannot be perfectly 
understood without some Study and Application; yet by a little 
Assistance from the Author, or others of the Profession properly quali[-]
fied, all the Difficulties will be soon surmounted. The Figures in each 
Plate are designed only to shew the Postures proper in Dancing, but 
not to bear the least Resemblance to any Person to whom the Plate 
is inscribed; which it had been ridiculous to have attempted: The sole 
Intent of the Inscription being to do Honour to my self, by this small 
Testimony of my Gratitude to some honourable Persons. The con[-]
tinual Change of the Fashion will afford, I presume, a sufficient Ex[-]
cuse for the Drapery of the Figures: and Gloves were designedly o[-]
mitted, on Purpose to shew the beautiful Shape of the Hands. The 
Faults, which may have happened in the Execution, either of the 
Printing, or Ingraving, will, I hope, be the more easily excused, if 
the Nicety of the Subject be considered, together with the Difficulty of 
the Performance, and the many Hands through which it has passed: 
especially if it be remembered, that this is not only my first Attempt, 
but likewise the first that has been made of the Kind._

_It may seem a little strange, that I should claim the Honour of having 
first treated of the_ Art of Dancing; _when a Book upon the same Sub[-]
ject was published in_ France _as long ago as in_ 1725. _But the fol[-]
lowing Account will, I hope, clear up all Doubt in Relation to the Jus[-]
tice of my Pretensions._

_In_ Mist's Journal Sat. Jan. 13 1728, _appeared this Advertisement, 
"Next Week will be published_ The Dancing-Master _or_ The Art of 
"Dancing explain'd _by Monsieur_ Rameau". _This gave me no small 
Surprize, having never before heard of either any such Book, or Au[-]
thor. {Page} Had it been my Fortune to have known, either before, or after 
I undertook to write on this Art, that such a Book was extant, my Cu[-]
riosity would certainly have led me to have consulted it; and had I 
approved it, 'tis highly probable I should have given the World a 
Translation of it, with some additional Observations of my own. This 
had been a much easier Task, than to compose a Work entirely new 
upon the same Subject: which I had actually finished in_ 1724 _ready 
for the Press, as it is now published, without any material Altera[-]
tion, a full Year before the Publication of Monsieur Rameau's Book, 
and near four Years before this Advertisement appeared; the Truth 
whereof several credible Witnesses have testified under their own 
Hands._

_I advertised this Work of mine the first Time, as ready for the 
Press, and that it only waited for a sufficient Number of Subscribers 
to defray the Expence, in_ Berington's Evening Post, Oct. 15, 
1726, _and again in the same Paper_ Oct. 22. _This Advertisement 
was repeated in_ The White-Hall Evening Post, Nov. 12. _and in_ 
The London Journal, Dec. 3. _In_ Mist's Journal _of_ March 4. 1727, _I 
gave Notice of the Publication of my Proposals, together with some 
Plates done by Way of Specimen; and renewed that Notice on 18th, 
in_ Berington's Evening Post, _and again on_ Oct. 28. _in the same Pa[-]
per. From this particular Account it appears, that I had published 
seven Advertisements concerning my Work; the first of which was 
two Years and three Months, before ever the Translation of Mon[-]
sieur Rameau's Book was advertised in_ Mist's Journal Jan. 13. 1728.
 
_To secure my self in some Measure from the Damage I might re[-]
ceive by this_ Advertisement; _I thought it necessary to publish one my 
self a few Days after, in_ Mist's Journal Jan. 27. _To which I pre[-]
fixed this Motto from_ V!!IRGIL!!, —Tulit alter Honores; _intimat[-]
ing, that another Person had attempted to bear away the Honour of 
my Invention; and I may justly add, the Profit of it too. That 
this was his Intention is very plain from two Circumstances: the Ad[-]
dition to the Title; and the Alteration of the Form of Monsieur_ Ra[-]
meau's _Book. The Title of his in the original is onely_ The Dancing 
Master; _to which the ingenious Translator, or perhaps Bookseller, thought 
{Page} proper to add that of mine,_ The Art of Dancing explain'd: _The 
French Original was published in_ Octavo; _but the Translation was mag[-]
nified to a_ Quarto, _almost the Size of mine, and yet proposed to be sold 
at half the Price. The assuming thus the very Title and Form of the Book 
proposed to the Publick by me, seems to have been done with no bet[-]
ter View, than to raise an Advantage by anticipating my Design; 
and to obstruct the Success of it, by making it seem to be only a servile 
Imitation of the original Invention of Monsieur_ Rameau. _This Con[-]
trivance was the more likely to have the Desired Effect, from the un[-]
favourable Situation in which the_ Proposals _for the Subscription to my 
Book might at that Time appear. It was above two Years since it 
had been advertised as ready for the Press: and this delay in the 
Publication, the not fixing any certain Time for it, and the Diffi[-]
culty in procuring Subscriptions, upon the Number of which the Pub[-]
lication must in depend, might probably induce many Persons to suspect 
that it would never be published at all. And this Difficulty would 
be much increased, by offering to the Public a Book on the same 
Subject, with the same Title, and of almost the same Size, which 
yet should cost no more than half the Price of mine. To make 
which Book appear still more perfect and complete, and mine less ne[-]
cessary, or useful, the Gentleman who published it was not satisfied 
to present it to the World merely as a Translation of Monsieur_ Ra[-]
meau'_s Work, approved by Monsieur Pecour, the greatest Master in_ 
France; _but was prompted by his Ingenuity and Generosity to make 
such surprizing Improvements in the Figures, as will be a lasting Mo[-]
nument of his great Abilities in the Art of Dancing.

_Before I conclude this Preface, it seems necessary to say some[-]
thing more particularly of my self, for the Satisfaction of those to 
whom I may not have the Honour to be known; who will naturally 
expect, before they encourage a Piece of such an extraordinary Na[-]
ture, to receive some Evidence, that the Person who undertakes it is 
in some measure qualified for the Performance._

_In_ April 1707. _I was placed as an Apprentice with Mr._ Thomas 
Caverley, _now living in_ Queen's-Square, _St._ George _the Martyr, 
with whom I continued till the Year_ 1714. During which Time, I 
{Page} had likewise the good Fortune to be further instructed in the Theatrical 
Way, by that great Performer Mr._ Cherreir, _once contemporary 
with the inimitable Mr._ L'Abbe, _with whom also I have had the 
Happiness of a Personal Acquaintance. Mr._ Cherreir'_s great Merit, 
after he quitted the Stage, was supported a long Time by the late 
Mr._ John Shaw, _who was justly esteemed not only one of the finest 
Theatrical Dancers, but one of the most beautiful Performers in the 
Gentleman-like Way: the Acquisition of both which Excellencies in 
Practice, must be chiefly owing to those admirable Instructions in the 
Theory, which he received from Mr._ Caverley, _when He and I were 
fellow Apprentices to that great Master._

_I beg Leave to mention in the next Place two of my Scholars, who 
have appeared upon the Stage with no small Applause. The one 
was Mr._ John Topham, _who danced upon both Theatres under the 
Name of Mr._ Kellom'_s Scholar, when he had been with me no lon[-]
ger than betwixt two and three Years. The other was Miss_ Frances, 
_who, on the Theatre Royal in_ Little Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, _performed 
the_ Passacaille de Scilla, _consisting of above a thousand Measures or 
Steps, without making the least Mistake; but the left me in the midst 
of her Improvement._

_To this I hope it will not be thought improper to subjoin a short Ac[-]
count of some of my Compositions, which have been well recei[-]
ved by the World. The_ Passepied Round O _in_ 1715 _dedicated to 
Mr._ Caverley; _the Shepherdess in_ 1716; _the_ Submission _in_ 1717, 
_which, by the Name of Mr._ Kellom's New Dance, _was performed 
by Monsieur and Mademoiselle_ Salle, _the two_ French _Children, on 
the Theatre in_ Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, _to very considerable Audiences, 
every Night, for a whole Week together. To which I beg Leave 
to add the_ Prince Eugene _in_ 1728[[опечатка? может всё же 18 год?
но в двух изданиях написано 28 год…]]; _the_ Address _the next Year; the_ 
Gavot _in_ 1720; _and the_ Passacaille Diana _the Year following, de[-]
dicated to Mr._ L' Abbe. _All which I composed, wrote in Charact[-]
ers, and published, for the Improvement of the_ Art of Dancing.

_I might here add a long Account of the Honour done me by many 
of the Nobility and Gentry in employing me to teach their Children; 
and in permitting me to publish it to the World by the Dedication of 
{Page} my Plates. But I have perhaps dwelt too long upon this Subject al[-]
ready, which I hope the candid Reader will excuse; and not impute 
this Account of my self to Vanity or Conceit, but to an earnest De[-]
sire in me to give the utmost Satisfaction to my Subscribers, and to 
remove all Suspicion of my Want of Talents proper for the Execu[-]
tion of this new Undertaking. And this was the more necessary to be 
done, because of the Disadvantage to which I have been exposed by 
going accidentally under two different Names,_ Kellom _and_ Tomlin[-]
son; _being known formerly by the first, but of late only by the last; 
the Occasion of which it may not be thought improper to relate._
 
_During the Time of my Apprenticeship I went generally by the 
Name of_ Kellom, _a Corruption of_ Kenelm _my true Christian Name; 
as it is very common for young Persons to be called Mr._ John, _Mr. 
William, and the like, without the Addition of their Sur-name. 
At the Expiration of my Apprenticeship, several of my Friends out 
of Respect called me by my Sur-name of_ Tomlinson; _but, being un[-]
willing to decline the Advantage I might probably receive from the 
Reputation of having learned the_ Art of Dancing _under so great a 
Master as Mr._ Caverley, _I chose rather to retain the Name of_ Kellom, 
_by which I had been so universally known to have been under his In[-]
struction. This Duplicity of Appellation turned afterwards to my 
great Disadvantage: many of the Nobility and Gentry, who would 
have had their Children taught by Mr._ Kellom, _refusing to employ 
Mr._ Tomlinson _tho' recommended to them; and many, who would 
have employed Mr._ Tomlinson, _rejecting Mr._ Kellom. _To pre[-]
vent which Confusion for the future, I shall acknowledge my self obli[-]
ged to those, who, instead of either singly, shall be pleased to call 
me by both conjunctly,_ Kellom Tomlinson.

### CHAP. I. 

### _Of STANDING_.

BEfore I proceed to treat on _Motion_, I apprehend it 
to be necessary to consider that Grace and Air so
highly requisite in our Position, when we _stand_ 
in Company;  for, having formed a true Notion of 
this, there remains nothing farther to be observed, 
when we enter upon the Stage of Life, either in 
Walking or Dancing, than to preserve the same.

And, for the better understanding of this important Point, let 
us imagine ourselves, as so many living Pictures drawn by the 
most excellent Masters, exquisitely designed to afford the utmost 
Pleasure to the Beholders: And, indeed, we ought to set our 
{4} Bodies in such a Disposition, when we stand in Conversation, that, 
were our Action or Postures delineated, they might bear the 
strictest Examination of the most critical Judges.

Let us, therefore, to draw nearer to the Subject in hand, inquire 
into the Nature of those Position that must be observed, in order 
to attain this fine and becoming Presence: And that our Readers 
may be furnished with proper Direction to arrive at the same, tho’ 
perhaps, our Rules may not be perfect as could have been wished, 
we flatter ourselves they will be of no small Use and Advantage; 
wherefore, without farther Apology, I shall enter upon the De[-]
scription of _Position_ in general.

_Position_, then, is the different Placing or Setting our Feet on 
the Floor, whether in Conversation or Dancing; and those for 
Conversation, or when we _stand_ in Company, are when the Weight 
rests as much on one Foot as the other, the Feet being consider[-]
ably separated or open, the Knees streight, the Hands placed by 
the Side in genteel Fall or natural Bend of the Wrists, and 
being in an agreeable Fashion or Shape about the Joint or Bend of 
the Hip, with the Head gracefully turning to the Right or Left, 
which compleats a most Heroic Posture; and, tho’ it may be impro[-]
per, in the Presence of Superiors, among Familiars, it is a bold and 
graceful Attitude, called the Second Position [[see Plate III]]: Or, when the 
Heel of the right or left Foot is inclosed or placed, without 
Weight, before the Ancle of that Foot by which the Poise is sup[-]
ported, the Hands being put between the Folds or Flaps of the 
Coat, or Waiste-coat, if the Coat is unbuttoned, with  a natural and 
easy Fall of the Arms from the Shoulders, this produced a very 
modest and agreeable Posture, named the Third Position inclosed [[see the Feet in Plate IV]]: 
Or, if the inclosed Foot be moved open from the other, sideways, 
to the Right or Left, about the Distance of half a Foot, or as 
far as, in setting it down to the Floor, the Weight of the Body 
resting on the contrary Foot is not disordered by it, with the 
Toes handsomely turning out, the Hat under one Arm, and the 
{5} other in some agreeable Action, the Head also turning a little from 
the Foot on which the Poise rests, this we stile the Fourth Posi[-]
tion open, and it may be very justly esteemed a most genteel and 
becoming Posture [[see Plate VIII ]].

The Positions, from which _Dancing_ dates its Original, consist 
of five Principles: As, first, when the Toes turning outwards, 
the two heel are equally placed together [[see Plate II]]. Secondly, when 
both Heels are considerably separated or open [[see Plate III]]. Thirdly, when 
the Poise rest upon one Foot, the other being inclosed or placed 
before the Ancle of that Foot by which the Weight is supported [[see Plate IV]]. 
Fourthly, when the inclosed Foot is advanced upon a right Line, 
about the Length of a Step in Walking [[see Plate IX]]. And, Fifthly, when 
the Heel of the advanced Foot is so crossed and placed before the 
Toe of that Foot on which the Body rests, as that the Turning 
may be made, and yet one Foot not, in the least, interrupt the 
other [[see Plate XI]]. Having briefly described the most agreeable Postures of 
_Standing_ in Conversation, and laid down the Rudiments of the 
whole Art of Dancing, I shall now proceed to treat on _Motion_, 
the Result of Position, and first begin with _Walking_.

### CHAP. II.

### _Of WALKING_.

WALKING consists of Motion and a Change of Place, by trans[-]
ferring the Weight or Poise of the Body from one Foot to the 
other, by stepping or advancing the disengaged Foot (whichsoever it 
be) from the first Position [[See Plate I.]] to the fourth advanced[[See Plate IX.]], and so alter[-]
nately, concluding as at first[[See Plate I.]], but always on the contrary Foot. In 
order to _walk_ gracefully, it is to be observed, that, during the 
Step or Motion made by the disengaged Foot, as above[[See Plate IX ]], the 
{6} whole Weight of the Body must rest on the same Foot as at com[-]
mencing it[[See Plate I.]], until the stepping Foot is advanced its due Length 
of Step[[See Plate IX.]]; and, on its receiving the Poise or Weight on the Ball 
or full Part of the Heel, upon setting it to the Ground or Floor, 
the now disengaged Foot, which at first supported the Weight, 
becoming by this means released, attends the Poise in a gentle and 
easy Motion, until it arrive in its former Position[[See Plate I.]]; but on the 
contrary Foot for the Step next ensuing, which is made in like 
Manner, and so on; for if, instead of the Body's waiting or attend[-]
ing the Motion of the stepping Foot, as above described[[See Plate IX.]], it 
should either go before or along with it, the Grace that ought 
to accompany our Steps, in _Walking_, is lost, because the Foot 
must constantly go before the Body[[See Plate IX.]], to receive it, otherwise it 
will always represent the Body in a falling Posture.

And it is farther to be noted, that, in _Walking_ with a good 
Grace, Time and Harmony must be observed, as well as in _Danc[-]
ing_: For Example, the setting down or receiving the Poise, at 
the End of the Step, is upon One; the taking up the disengaged 
Foot, by a gentle and easy raising the Heel and pointing the 
Toe, in one intire Motion, which is the Manner of taking up 
the Foot to step, is upon _Three_[[See Plate I.]]; and _Two_ is in the coming up 
of the disengaged Foot, after the Step has been made[[See Plate I.]], which 
may be continued faster or slower, but must always be in one 
certain Time, counting _One, Two_, and _Three_, as in Music. And, 
by this Method, the Body with a good Grace resting or stand[-]
ing, 'till two Thirds of the Three we count, must necessarily add 
great Beauty to our _Walking_, which is the Case under Considera[-]
tion; for the Step is made upon One[[See Plate IX.]], the Preparation or Taking 
up the Foot, to make the Step, Three[[See Plate I.]], and _Two_ is in the coming up of the released Foot, to continue our _Walking_.

And, as to the Motion of the Arms in _Walking_, they will na[-]
turally have their due Course or Swing, in a continual Contrast or 
Opposition to the Feet; for, when the right Foot steps for[-]
wards[[See the second Figure or Woman's Side in Plate IX.]], {7} the left Arm advances, in Contradiction, as the right 
Arm does, when the left Foot steps forwards[[See the first Figure in Plate IX.]], and so alter[-]
nately; and the like in _Walking_ backwards, in Relation to the 
Contrast, but not with Respect to the Arms, because, in _Walking_ 
backwards, the Contradiction is between the same Arm and Foot; 
for, when the right Foot steps back[[See the first Figure in Plate IX.]], the right Arm advances 
in Opposition, as, when the left Foot steps backwards[[See also the second Figure in Plate IX.]], the 
left Arm advances, as aforesaid, and so on, if continued. Having, 
I hope, offered what will prove satisfactory, on this Head, I shall 
next inquire into the different Sorts of _Bows_ and _Courtesies_ in Conversation.

### CHAP. III.

### _Of BOWING, or the different Sorts of 
    HONOURS._

BOWS or _Courtesies_ are the outward Marks of Respect we pay 
to others, which, in one Sex, are shewed by bowing the 
Body, but, in the other, by bending the Knees; and, if made in 
a regular Manner, they are, indeed, very grand, noble, and highly 
ornamental. They accompany our Conversation, as well in _Stand[-]
ing_ as _Walking_; in the former, on breaking off a Conversation, as 
in taking Leave, or by way of Acknowledgment for some Favour 
or obliging thing spoken in our Praise; and in the latter, when 
we enter a Room, or meet a Person passing either on the 
Right or Left. These are the two different Classes or Sorts of _Bows_ and 
_Courtesies_, which are, as it were, founded on the two preceding 
Chapters of _Standing_ and _Walking_; and, to begin with leaving a 
Room, which relates to the first of the said Orders, I shall ob[-]
serve, {8} that Taking Leave in Conversation consists in stepping 
aside, bowing, and leaving the disengaged Foot pointed, side[-]
ways, in one intire Motion to the first Division of the Bow or 
counting of _One_[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]], during which it remains the Respect or count[-]
ing of _Two_[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]]; and, in the graceful Raising of the Body upon 
_Three_, it is drawn pointed, with the Knees streight 'till it crosses 
behind the Foot on which the Poise rests, and stands erect on the 
Foot that it crosses behind[[See the 3d Plate in Book the 2d.]], to be repeated as often as Occasion 
requires; and it is to be noted, that the Respect, if repeated, is 
always made to the same Hand; if the Leave be taken to the 
Right, the Stepping aside is always with the right Foot[[See the 2d Plate in Book the 2d]], as it 
is always to the Left, if taken the contrary Way[[See Plate 4 in Book the 2d]].

In Conversation with a Gentleman or Lady standing, the very 
same _Bow_ is made, as in leaving a Room, the receiving the Poise 
on the Foot drawn behind excepted[[See the 3d Plate in Book the 2d.]]; but, instead thereof, it 
remains, on Conclusion of the Bow, in the Third Position, upon 
the Point, without Weight, behind the foremost Foot which here 
supports the Poise, in readiness to repeat the Respect, if neces[-]
sary[[See the Feet in Plate 5.]], because, in this Bow of Repetition, it always steps first 
to one Hand[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]], and then to the other[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]], in order to preserve the 
same Ground; otherwise, if made as leaving a Room[[See Plate 3, Book the 2d]], it 
would have the contrary Effect and cause the Persons to retire, 
instead of resting in the same Place; and it is a very genteel and 
becoming Bow, if the Stepping aside, Bow, and Point of the dis[-]
engaged Foot, be made, at once[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]], and a Pause or Counting 
of _Two_ is observed between the Stepping aside and Bowing[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]], 
and the graceful Rising up again from thence, in drawing of the 
pointed Foot up, at the same Time, into the abovementioned 
Position[[See the Feet in Plate 5]], be also in one intire Motion. As to the Reverence 
or Courtesy of a Lady, on the present Occasion, with
Regard to the Feet, it is much the same, but not so, in Relation to 
the Body; because, as I have already said, the Respect the former 
{9} shews to any is by bending the Body, but the Courtesy or Respect, 
which a Lady pays to those of either Sex, is by a graceful Bend[-]
ing of the Knees[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], accompanied with a becoming and suitable 
Disposition of the different Parts of the Body: As, having the 
Hands before them, in some agreeable Posture supporting, as it 
were, the slanting or falling Shoulders, which, at the same Time, 
lengthen and more gracefully expose a fine Neck, as well as a 
beautiful Face composed of so many delicate and charming Fea[-]
tures, with which they are usually adorned by the Bounty of 
Nature; and, tho' it may be, in some Measure, presumptuous to 
attempt any Addition to the natural Charms of the Fair Sex, I 
flatter myself they will forgive me, if I acquaint them, that a 
modest Look or Direction of the Eye, an agreeable Smile or a 
lively and pleasant Aspect, with a Chin neither poked out nor 
curbed in, but the whole Countenance erect and graceful, will add 
a Lustre to the whole, where any of these are wanting, whether 
in one Sex or the other; and, together with the easy Situation 
or Posture of the whole Head, Neck, and Arms, with the hand[-]
some Turn of the Feet, they compleat the intire Fashion or 
agreeable Disposition of a fine accomplished Lady, as well in 
Conversation in general, as the _Courtesy_[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], or _Walking_, from its 
being thus disposed, from Top to Toe, is only to preserve the 
graceful Position of the Body, as above described.

It only now remains to inquire, whether a Lady steps aside and 
makes her Honour, in the Manner we have shewn a Gentleman 
leaves a Room, after stepping aside[[See Plate the 2d in Book the 2d]], by drawing the disen[-]
gaged or pointed Foot[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]] into the first Position, equal to the 
Foot, which stepped aside[[See Plate the 2d]], instead of drawing it crossing be[-]
hind, as aforesaid[[See the 4th and 11th Plates]]; or that Courtesying, without stepping aside 
at all[[See Plate the 2d]], as some do, is only to let the Weight or graceful Fashion 
of the Body, as just described, fall, or rather feat itself, as on a 
{10} Chair or Stool, without Disorder, upon that Foot which is 
drawn or crossed behind[[See the 4th and 11th Plates]], as in leaving Company, or on both 
Legs equally alike[[See Plate the 2d]], if the pointed Foot be drawn into the first 
Position[[See Plate the 2d]]; and the like, if made on both Legs, without moving 
from the same Place[[See Plate the 2d]], only with this Difference, in Relation to 
the Weight's coming upon the pointed Foot[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]] or that which is crossed behind[[See the 4th and 11th Plates]], after touching the Heel of the Foot on 
which the Poise rests[[See the Feet in Plate 5]], in like Manner as when the Gentleman 
takes Leave[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], and retires back, as it were a Seat for the Weight 
to rest upon[[See the 4th and 11th Plates]], whilst the _Courtesy_ or Lady's Respect is paid, 
upon the Beginning or first Division; whereas, in a Bow for the 
Man, it does not receive the Weight, 'till the third Division[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], 
resting the Counting of _Two_ for the Respect, as we have ob[-]
served, in the contrary Sex; and, upon counting of _Three_ or com[-]
pleating the Courtesy, it rises in the same slow, graceful, and de[-]
liberate Manner, 'till it stands upright on the crossing behind 
Foot[[See Plate the 3d in Book the 2d]], as at first it seated itself thereon, in the Courtesy or 
Bending of the Knees[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], compleating the Respect or Courtesy, 
on a Lady's leaving a Room, in the disengaged or foremost 
Foot's being at Liberty to renew the Respect, as Occasion 
requires[[See Plate the 3d in Book the 2d]].

As to which Foot the Stepping aside begins with, in Rela[-]
tion to taking of Leave, it is altogether the same, as was 
described for the other Sex; but, as this Courtesy or Respect has 
the like Effect, as I observed, in treating of the _Bow_ in Con[-]
versation with another; viz. Retiring from each other, it is to 
be evaded in rising, by transferring the Poise from the hindmost 
Foot to the foremost, which, being then at Liberty, is ready to 
repeat the Complaisance on the contrary Side, and so to pre[-]
serve the same Ground. And the like may be said, in Rela[-]
tion to concluding the Courtesy on the stepping aside Foot, 
{11} when the pointed Foot is drawn into the first Position[[See Plate the 2d]]; or the like, 
without stepping at all, by swaying or waving the principal 
Part of the Body, as Occasion offers, either upon the right[[See the 2d Figure or Woman's Side in Plate 1]] 
or left Foot[[See the 1st Figure in Plate 1]], as will be most to Advantage, in the graceful 
bending or sinking down upon the Knees[[See the 2d and 4th Plates in the 2d Book]]; which Wave or 
Sway of the Body not a little contributes to the Beauty of the 
Courtesy, as does also the handsome Position of the Waiste, 
neither too much forwards nor backwards, the whole Poise of 
the Body being beautiful and upright, as before described, 
directly perpendicular or right down over the Heel or Heels, 
on which the Poise rests[[See Plate 2d in the 2d Book]]; and this, I think, concludes all that 
is necessary to be said, concerning the _Reverence_ or _Courtesy_ 
made by Persons of either Sex, according to the first Class, 
relating to _Position_ or _Standing_, at leaving a Room, or in Con[-]
versation with others.

I now proceed to the Second Sort of HONOURS, viz. those which 
are introduced by _Motion_, as in _Walking_, _&c_. and I shall, first, finish 
what concerns the Ladies, before I return to the Gentlemen, who 
are to observe, that, at the End of the last Step, after their 
Entrance into a Room, before they pay their Respect or _Honour_, 
they are to make a graceful Pause or _Stand_ upon the Foot 
that made the last Step, which, as has been already said, in 
_Walking_, is compleated upon counting of _One_; so that the whole 
Person rests the counting of _Two_, in the coming up of the 
disengaged Foot into the first _Position_, equal to the Foot which 
made the last Step preparatory for the _Courtesy_[[See the 1st and 2d Plates]]; and _Three_ 
is the Rest it makes, when thus joined in the graceful Disposi[-]
tion of the whole Fashion, or upon taking it up, if afterwards 
stepping aside[[See Plate 1]], and thus erect from Head to Foot, it is 
duly prepared to make the Courtesy in that smooth Manner of 
bending the Knees we have described, directing the Eye, as Occa[-]
sion {12} requires; or the like, if the _Courtesy_ be made in stepping
 aside, as in taking Leave[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], for there is no other Difference be[-]
tween the _Honour_ or Respect, on leaving Company and coming 
up to them, than that, as I have observed, the former proceeds 
from _Position_ or _Standing_[[See the 4th, 5th and 8th Plates]], and the latter is introduced by _Mo[-]
tion_ or _Walking_[[See Plate 1]]; but, having shewn, what that _Preparation_ is, there 
is no Occasion for any farther Enlargement.

If a Lady makes an _Honour Passing_, either on the Right or 
Left, or in meeting any One, in _Conversation_, _Walking_, or the 
like, at the End of the Step preceding the Complaisance or 
Respect, the turns about half way towards the Person, upon Con[-]
clusion of the said preparatory Step or Counting of _One_; and, 
upon Counting of _Two_, the lets the disengaged or coming up Foot 
touch the Heel of that Foot which stepped, crossways, before 
the said coming up Foot[[See the Feet in Plate 5]], which now attends the Poise, in 
order to make the _Honour_; and, upon _Three_, the sets it down, 
somewhat obliquely or slanting off from the Person to whom 
the Respect is paid, without Weight[[See the Feet in Plate 10]], and thus becomes duly 
prepared to make the _Courtesy_[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]]; I mean, when the Head is 
beautifully turned to the Right or Left, according to the Side 
on which the Respect is made, in a graceful Contrast of the 
whole Fashion; and, being so disposed, the makes the _Honour_ 
by a smooth and easy Bending of the Knees. The whole Poise 
of the Body, during the Counting of _One_ or Bending, as afore[-]
said, rests the Counting of _Two_[[See Plates 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], or, as we have already said, 
the Respect in a fine Contrast; and, upon the _third Division_ or com[-]
pleating the _Courtesy_, it rises gracefully from the Foot on which 
it rested, all the while, in this becoming Twist, Passing on, 'till 
it stands erect upon the Foot which was placed or advanced for 
that Purpose[[See the Feet in Plate 10]], by transferring the Poise from the Foot that 
made the preparatory Step for this Respect, which, being now at 
{13} Liberty, is ready to repeat the same, as often as Occasion requires[[See Plate 1]]; 
and from hence it becomes a Kind of _Walking Courtesy_, chang[-]
ing the Poise from one Foot to the other. And it is to be noted, 
that it must always be the Foot next the Person, which makes 
the last Step in _Walking_, before the Respect: For Instance, if 
the Person be on the Right, the right Foot makes the Step; and 
the left, if the _Honour_ be paid to the other Side, turning, as 
before described, towards the Person or Foot which made the 
Step in Preparation for the _Courtesy_, and directing the Eye, side[-]
ways, upon the Person to whom the Respect is paid, instead of 
right forwards, as when entering a Room, or meeting One, which 
is the only Difference. And it is to be farther observed, that, 
tho' this Complaisance may be repeated, once or more, after pas[-]
sing a Person, it must never be made, before we come parallel 
to the Person to whom we pay this Respect; and if Occasion 
requires its being transferred to the other Side, which often 
falls out, as when Company are seated or standing, on both Sides 
of a Room or Gallery, _&c_. we continue _walking on_, till we arrive 
at the next Occasion of paying this Respect, as when Company 
are scattered, at some Distance, and then make the Pause or 
Stand, at the End of the Step next the Person or Persons, 
by turning, _&c_. as before; or if the Change or Transferring may 
be soonest performed, as when Company are thick on both Sides, 
it must be divided by two Steps made between the preceding 
_Courtesies_, the second Step preparing to pay the Respect, as I 
have already shewn, which will be the left Foot, the foregoing 
_Honour_ being supposed to the Right; and the right Foot, if the 
Complaisance be first paid to the Left. And, in these _Passing 
Honours_, it must be noted, that no Regard is to be observed, 
with Respect to the Quality of the Person, but only Conveniency, 
in Relation to the Right or Left, as the Company first present 
themselves, as we pass along; nor, indeed, can it well be otherwise, 
{14} because they are all to receive it, in their Turns. As what has 
been said is all that I apprehend to be material, relating to 
the _Ladies_, I flatter myself, that they will not be wanting in 
putting these Rules into Practice, since I have been at so great 
Pains in composing them for their Service.

I shall now proceed to the Conclusion of what I have to offer 
to the _Gentlemen_, on this Head, which is much to the like Effect 
with what was observed to the _Ladies_; for, when a _Gentlemen_ 
enters a Room, the graceful Stand or Rest he makes, as already 
described, in the _Courtesy_ for a _Lady_ on this Occasion, must be 
always made on the last Step before _Bowing_, which may be on 
the left Foot; whilst the right, in coming up, as aforesaid, in its 
Attendance on the Poise, instead of ending in the first Position[[See Plate 1]],
 as in _Walking_, is placed considerably more open, sideways, without 
Weight, the Heel being somewhat raised, the Ball or Instep point[-]
ed or pressing lightly on the Floor, the Knee streight, and the 
whole Weight of the Body, in a Gentleman-like Manner, resting 
on the left Foot[[See the Feet in the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate 6]], bows, as Occasion requires, by bending the 
Body and scraping the open Foot, at the same Time, in one 
intire _Motion_ forwards; upon the Counting of _One_[[See the Feet of the 2d Figure in Plate 9]], remains the 
Respect or Counting of _Two_, in this respectful Posture, with 
the Knee on which the Body rests bended, to prevent its being 
awry, which otherwise would be the Consequence, and the Arms 
naturally hanging under the Shoulders; and, upon _Three_, it rises 
from this humble Posture in one intire slow _Motion_, 'till it stands 
erect on the right or scraping Foot; and the left, at the same Time, 
being released from the Weight of the Body, falls into the first 
_Position_, as in _Walking_[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 1]], to repeat it, if it be necessary.

The _Bow Passing_ differs, in no Respect, from that advancing or 
coming into a Room, except in the Situation of the Person: For 
Instance, in entering a Room, the Person is before us, but only 
{15} upon one Side, on the present Occasion. From hence it appears, 
that, after the Step preceding the _Bow_ and Pause, placing the 
contrary Foot or Preparative, is made[[See the Feet of the 2d Figure in Plate 6]], the Respect is paid in 
the very same Method, as forwards, only that the Body is turned 
in a beautiful and agreeable Twist or Contrast, sideways, looking 
upon the Person to whom we pay the Respect; if the _Bow_ be 
made upon the Right, the antecedent Step is made with the 
left Foot, and the right, during the Pause, is placed for the 
Scrape in _Bowing_[[See the Feet of the 2d Figure in Plate 6]]; as, if it be made on the contrary Side, the 
right Foot makes the preparatory Step, and the left will be 
placed, as aforesaid, to pay the Respect[[See the Feet of the 1st Figure in Plate 6]]; and, if repeated, it 
will always begin and end with the same Foot, 'till changed 
by adding a second Step, which transfers the _Bow_ to the other 
Side, as Occasion offers. This _Bow_ is also made, in _walking_ 
with a _Gentleman_ or _Lady_, upon some obliging Expression in 
Conversation, once or oftener, as Necessity requires, with the 
right Foot scraping, if the Person be on the Right, but the 
contrary Foot, if the Person be on the Left. It must also be 
noted, that the Step made, before placing the Foot for the _Bow_, 
is to be made with the contrary Foot to the Side the Person is 
on, to whom the Respect is paid, and the placed Foot is that 
next the Person; tho' it is the Reverse in the _Ladies_, because 
the Step preparatory for this Respect is made with the Foot 
next the Person, and the contrary is the placed Foot.

It will not be improper, before I conclude with the _Gentlemen_, 
to take some farther Notice of a Difficulty that may arise, in the 
Application of the _Bow Passing_; I mean, the Changing or Transf[-]
erring it from one Side to the other, because, in Passing through 
a Lane or Room full of Company, we cannot, as I have already 
observed to the _Ladies_, bow on both Sides, at once; and therefore 
the Rule is, to pay this Respect to those that first fall in our Way, 
{16} and, if possible, conclude on that Side, and then, by walking two 
Steps or more, to make the like Compliments on the other; 
which will be, by bowing and scraping the left Foot[[See the Feet of the 1st Figure in Plate 6]], if the 
first Respect be paid to the Right, and the contrary Foot, if it be 
first paid to the Left[[See the Feet of the 2d Figure in Plate 6]]. And if it should fall out, as in St. _James's 
Park_, or other publick Places, where you may walk, perhaps, a 
considerable Way, before you find an Occasion for paying this 
Respect, you are to note, that these _Bows_, as we said, in Rela[-]
tion to the _Ladies Courtesies_, are never made, before you come 
equal to those you salute; and, if it be a Person of Nobility or 
extraordinary Fashion, an additional Bow, sideways, as when 
leaving a Room, may be added, with the contrary Foot to that 
which made the Scrape, turning full to the Person to whom you 
pay this uncommon Respect, in passing; nor must you forget, 
that, in entering a Room, or meeting any one, it is always to 
be added to the _Bow Forwards_, as being of singular Use, in paying 
Respect to the Company in general, as the former is to the 
Person we salute in particular, by a Cast of our Eye round the 
Company, omitting none, for an Omission may, many Times, 
be esteemed an Affront and ill Manners. It will be likewise 
expedient to observe, that some _Ladies_ make the _Passing Honour_ 
the very same, as that I have described for the _Gentlemen_; the 
only Difference is, that, after placing the Foot[[See Plate 6]], instead of _bowing_, 
in the Scrape of the Foot[[See the Feet in Plate 9]], they _courtesy_ to the Right[[See the Feet of the 2d Figure in Plate 6]] or 
Left[[See the Feet of the 1st Figure in the same Plate]], as Occasion requires, in the graceful Contrast described 
for the other Sex's _Bowing_, concluding on the scraping Foot[[See the Feet in Plate 9]]; 
which, if on the Right, will be the right Foot[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 9, and 2d of Plate 1]], and left at 
Liberty to step and place the preparatory Foot; as, on the con[-]
trary Side, it will conclude on the left Foot[[See the 1st Figure in Plate 9, and 1st of Plate 1]], and the right will 
{17} then be in Readiness to make the Step, and place the Foot, in 
order to its being repeated, according to the various Occasions 
before mentioned. Some also use this Method of _Courtesying_, 
when they enter a Room, or meet, a Person, which is, in all 
Respects, agreeable to the _Gentleman's Bow_, as above described, 
except in the Scrape or Sliding of the prepared Foot forwards[[See the Feet in Plate 9]], 
_viz_. to bend both Knees, at the same Time, and to let the Poise 
fall gracefully upon the hind Foot, during the first and second 
Divisions; and afterwards the Body rises beautifully, as aforesaid, 
'till it stands on the advanced Foot[[See the Feet in Plate 9]], by transferring the Weight 
from the hind Foot, which, being released, is ready to _walk_[[See Plate 1]], and 
place the contrary Foot, in order to repeat it, in like Manner, if 
necessary: Or, if the _Courtesy_ used, at leaving a Room, be 
added[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], it will then, in all Respects, be answerable to the _Gen[-]
tleman's Bow_, at coming into a Room. But in Fine, let the 
_Bow_ or _Courtesy_, notwithstanding all the various Methods, and 
the several Occasions, here described, be made in which of those 
Forms we please, they cannot fail of being performed to Ad[-]
vantage, but must necessarily produce a good Effect, provided 
they be made in the Manner already shewn, upon Counting of 
_One_[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], the Pause or Rest _Two_[[See Plates the 2d and 4th in Book the 2d]], and the Rising upon _Three_[[See Plate 3d in Book the 2d]]. 
Having, therefore, in this Discourse upon _Honours_ in general, 
endeavoured to take Notice of every Particular, that might prove 
useful or instructive, so as to omit nothing material, I flatter 
myself, that, if it be not, in all Respects, accomplished, accord[-]
ing to my Intentions, the Difficulty of the Subject will plead 
my Excuse; and, as I have, in the preceding Chapters, regularly 
gone through what I apprehended necessary, upon _Standing_, 
_Walking_, and _Honours_ in general, under the last of which Heads, 
as the Reader will easily perceive, it was scarce possible to avoid 
some Repetitions, in my treating distinctly on _Bows_ and _Cour[-]
tesies_, I shall now proceed to the various _Steps_ of _Dancing_.

### {18} CHAP. IV. 

###_Of the DANCING-ROOM._

BEFORE I enter upon the various _Steps_ of _Dancing_, it will be 
necessary to describe the Room in which the _Dancing_ or _Steps_ 
are to be performed; which indeed seems to claim our more 
immediate Notice, since it will greatly assist us, in forming clear 
and distinct Notions of the ensuing Work.

First then, you are to observe, that the Shape and Figure of 
_Rooms_ differ exceedingly; for some are of a direct Square, others 
not square but oblong or longish, namely, when the two Sides 
are somewhat longer than the Top or Bottom, and various others 
that, in Reality, are of no Form at all; which renders _Dancing_ 
extremely difficult and confused to those, who have not a just 
and true Idea of the Room, in its different Situations; because, 
if this be wanting, altho' they may perform very handsomely, 
at their own _Houses_, or in _School_ with a Master, yet, in _Assem[-]
blies_ or _Rooms Abroad_, they are as much disordered and at a 
Stand, as if in an _Uninhabited Island_. I therefore conclude, that the 
Crime, if it should by any be esteemed such, of dwelling some[-]
what longer than I intended on this Subject, will the more 
easily be pardoned by the _Ladies_ and _Gentlemen_, when I acquaint 
them, that it intirely proceeded from the earnest Desire I have 
of rendering them Service, by endeavouring to remove the above 
mentioned Causes of Disorder and Confusion; which I cannot but 
persuade myself will meet with a favourable Reception, especially 
from the Hands of those who, by this Means, shall receive Improve[-]
ment.

{19} Encouraged by such a pleasing Prospect, I proceed to inform 
the _Gentlemen_ and _Ladies_, that, when they are about to _dance_ 
in a _Room_ of the first Sort, _viz._ a direct Square[[See the Square or Room, marked 1, in the 1st Plate distinguish'd by the Letter A]], the _dance_ 
may be begun, at any of the four Sides or Parts of the Square 
or Room; but then they are to note, that the Side or Part, 
on which the Dance begins, is always called the _Bottom_ or _Lower 
End_[[See the Letters A B in the said Square]]; the Side or Part which they face, the _Presence_ or _Upper 
End_[[See the Letters C D]]; and the two remaining Parts or Sides of the _Room_ 
receive their Names, according to the Hand they are on: For 
Instance, the Side, to which the right Shoulder points, is call'd 
the _right Side_[[See the Letters E F]], and the other the _left_[[See the Letters G H]]; from whence it is 
to be understood, that the Back is to the Lower End of the 
Room, and the Face to the Upper, so that, if, instead of Begin[-]
ning, as aforesaid, you was to commence, either upon the right 
or left Sides, they would not be then _Sides_, as before, but the 
_Upper_ and _Lower Ends_ of the Room; that is to say, if upon 
the right Side[[See the Letters A B in the Square mark'd 2]] the left would be the _Presence_ or _Upper End_[[See the Letters C D in the said Square]], 
and if upon the left[[See the Letters A B in the Room or Square marked 3]] the right[[See the Letters C D in the said Square]], and consequently the Parts 
or Sides, which at first were the _Lower_[[See the Letters A B in the Square marked 1]]  and _Upper Ends_[[See the Letters C D in the same Square]], 
now are the Sides; but all this is subservient to, and depends 
upon the Company, who must always be seated at the _Presence_ 
or _Upper End_.

As to the _longish_ or second Sort of _Rooms_, they differ from the 
_Square_, in the Sides being longer than the Ends[[See the Letters E F G H in the Rooms marked 4, 5, 6]]; and it of 
Course follows, that the _Dance_ must begin, at one of the said 
Ends[[See the Letters A B in the Rooms marked 4, 5, 6]], which is likewise decided by the Company; or, if the 
Door be hung near the End of one of the Sides, as usually it is, 
{20} the _Dance_ commonly begins, at the End next the Door[[See the following Mark + in the Rooms aforesaid]]. 
However that be, the _Dancers_ must have a particular Regard to 
the _Presence_ and _Bottom of the Room_, where they begun, other[-]
wise it is no Wonder
that those, who are of a timorous and bash[-]
ful Nature, with the Fears of being out together with the 
various Turnings and Windings of some _Dances_, should be per[-]
plex'd and nonpluss'd; and this I have perceived to be the 
Case, when I have seen a _Minuet_ begun at the _Bottom_ of the Room, 
and ended at the _Upper End_; which could not possibly have 
happened, had they observed the preceding Rules.

I shall, for the more fully Clearing of this Point, add an Obser[-]
vation or two more that may be of Service: Supposing one Page 
or Leaf of the Book you now read, or any other, to be the 
Room or Floor in which the _Dances_ or Practise of the Steps 
contain'd in the following Work are to be perform'd, lay it flat 
and open upon a Window or Table, at the Upper End of the 
Room; and if, when the Book is open, the two Pages make 
a Square, it will be agreeable to the _first_ Room, and the one 
half or single Page to the _longish_ or _second_; but you are to 
take special Notice, as to the Part or End of the Room intended 
for the _Presence_, that the Title or Page of the Book be so placed 
or laid upon the Table or Ground, as that, when you stand at 
the Bottom facing the Upper Part of the Room, to perform 
the foresaid _Steps_ or _Dances_, you can read the said Book: Or, 
supposing the whole Floor to be the same Book, and to contain 
the Matter written in the Page or half Page, the Book lying 
fix'd and immoveable upon the Table or Ground, let the Turn be 
made to the Right or Left, in a Quarter, Half, or Three-quarter 
Turn, and you cannot possibly make the least Mistake; for tho' 
the Book, by which you are directed in Compliance therewith, 
turns along with you, yet any other you shall lay upon the 
Ground will remain fix'd; so that from what has been said upon 
{21} this Head, I think it plainly appears, that the Lower End of the 
Page or Leaf is the Bottom of the Room, and the Title above 
the Presence or Upper End; the Beginning of the Lines, as 
you read these in _Dancing_, is the left Side, and the Breaking 
off of the Lines the right[[See the 7th Example of the Book in the Plate of the Room]], tho' the Sides of the Book are 
not so term'd. The Reason of this may be understood, by plac[-]
ing a Person at the Upper End of the Room facing the Bottom, 
holding a printed Book or written Paper perpendicular in his 
Hands, so as that you can read it; for you will find it the Re[-]
verse to _Dancing_, in that the right Hand will hold the Part of 
the Paper from whence the Lines begin, and the left that where 
they break off. It is farther to be noted, that, supposing the 
_Dance_ for _one_ Person alone in the square Room or two Pages 
of the Book, as just mentioned, the _Dancer_ places him or her[-]
self in the Center, or upon the Joining of the two Pages, which, 
when open, is directly in the Middle[[See the Letter S in the said 7th Example]]; or, to Practise any Step 
of this Book, the Case is the same; but, if the _Dance_ be of _two_, 
the _Lady_ takes the right Side of the said Center or Line[[See the Letter W in the Example aforesaid]], and 
the _Gentleman_ the left[[See the Letter M in the before mentioned Example]], so that the joining or presenting of Hands, if necessary, would fall upon the Line or Center upon 
which the single _Dancer_ begun[[See the Letter S in the said 7th Example]]; in which it is to be noted, 
as on other Occasions, that the _Lady_ takes the Right of the _Gentleman_.

And as I have now said what, I hope, will prove sufficient 
to remove all the Difficulties that may arise, in _Dancing_, on Ac[-]
count of the _Room_, or in Relation to the _Steps_ I am about 
to explain, I shall no longer detain those who are ambitious of 
attaining to Perfection in a Science, of which I have the Ho[-]
nour of being a Professor; but, having prepared and made them 
thoroughly acquainted with the _Room_, in which the _Steps_ of _Danc[-]
ing_ {22} are to be perform'd, I shall invite them into the same; but, 
before I describe the various _Steps_ of _Dancing_, I shall, in a few 
Words, endeavour to prepare their Minds to form a clearer and 
more distinct Idea of the following Descriptions.

As the _Human Structure_ is composed of different Parts, _viz_. 
Head, Neck, Body, Arms, Legs, Feet, _&c_. so likewise is 
_Dancing_ of Positions, Steps, Sinking, Rising, Springing, Caper[-]
ing, Falling, Sliding, Turning, Figures, Cadence or Time, _&c_. 
And as the Head consists of Eyes, Ears, Nose, Mouth, _&c_. the 
_Arms_, of the Shoulders, Elbows, Wrists, Hands, Fingers, and 
Joints of the Fingers, the _Body_, as it were, remaining in the 
Center or Middle of the Human Frame, supporting the said _Arms_, 
as the _Legs_, which support them both, are composed of the 
Hips, Knees, Ancles, Feet, Toes, and Joints[[See the Figure in Plate III]] of the said Toes, 
on the first of which the Rising upon the Instep is always made; 
and as all these different Parts have their peculiar Excellencies, 
to adorn the Whole, so the Eyes give Life to the Face, as well 
as direct the Steps; the Ears mark Time to the Tune; the 
Nose, as it were, points out the graceful Twists or Turns the 
Head makes, in Opposition to the other Parts of the Body, 
whilst the Mouth, at the same Time, adds those becoming Smiles, 
which, together with the Brightness and Lustre of the Eyes, 
compleat a most agreeable and pleasing Countenance. The Neck 
too, in its graceful Compliance with the Turn of the Head; the 
Shoulders, in their natural Rising, Falling, or Hanging down[[See the different Parts, as above described, in the Ladies Figures contained in the 2d Book]]; 
the Elbows, in their easy Bendings, according to the Occasion[[See the Figures in Plate 10]]; 
the Wrists, in their pliable Correspondence with the Elbows and 
Shoulders, as the handsome Shaping or Bending of the Thumbs 
and Fingers produces beautiful Hands compleating the Arms[[See the Parts above mentioned in the Arms and Fingers contained in Plate 13]]; 
which, in their respective Opposing the Head, in Conjunction 
{23} with the Body, is a farther and large Addition to the Whole[[See the Turn of the Head, Body, and Arms, of the Figures in Plate 6, or in the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 14th Plates.]]; 
the Legs, in the gracefully supporting the Frame of the Body, 
Head, Neck, and Arms[[See the Figures contained in the 3d, 6th, and 8th Plates]]; and the Hips or Joints, which unite 
the Legs and Body, agree with the various Movements or Bend[-]
ings and Risings of the Knees or Insteps[[See the Figures in the 3d and 10th Plates]], the Positions or 
handsome Turn of the Feet compleating the Beauty of the Legs, 
on the neat Management of which the Perfection of _Dancing_ 
so much depends[[See the Feet of the Figures in general]]; and these together, in Confederacy with 
the Head, oppose the Body and Arms, rendering the whole 
Body compleat and capable of _Dancing_, in all its various Atti[-]
tudes or Postures[[See the Figures in the 4th, 6th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 14th Plates]].

Having, by the foregoing Simile or Comparison, given an Ac[-]
count of the outward Form of the _Human Structure_, so far as 
it relates to, or corresponds with _Dancing_, or may, in any Respect, 
conduce to the better Understanding of the ensuing Subject, by 
running over the different Parts of the _Body_, from the Head 
to the Feet, which compose the Positions, with a short Expla[-]
nation of the said Parts, shewing how they agree in forming 
the most pleasing Object, to grace the ART of DANCING[[See the Figures in Plate 13, &c]], 
before I proceed to treat on its various Steps, I shall, by the way, 
observe, that the foresaid Particulars, from whence the whole 
BODY or ART of DANCING is produced, namely, _Position, Sink[-]
ing, Stepping, Rising, Springing, &c_. are of the very same Use, in 
_Dancing_, as the _Alphabet_, in the _Composition of Words_; for as 
Words vary and are produced, according to the different placing 
of the Letters; and different Subjects, Languages, _&c_. accord[-]
ing to the different Composition of Words; or, as in _Music_, 
by the different placing of the Notes, that compose the Gamut 
upon the Scale or Spaces between the Lines, are produced dif[-]
ferent {24} Sounds, which, as they ascend or descend, compose various 
Bars or Measures, that may be compared to Words, and the 
various Bars and Measures compose the various Pieces of _Music_, 
in different Keys and Movements; so the different _Steps_ of _Dancing_ 
are produced, according to the various Placings of the _Sinks, 
Risings, Bounds, _&c_._ upon the _Step_, whether consisting of one, 
two, three or more Steps to the Measure, and the different 
Steps produce Variety of _Dances_, according to the Composer's 
Fancy, upon all Sorts of Movements in _Music_, whether _grave_ 
or _brisk_.

We are, next, to shew, how these Actions or Motions of 
the _Body_, which, as we said above, compose the whole A!!RT!! of D!!ANCING!!, correspond with the Positions and various Motions and Steppings of the Feet, in composing the following Steps and Movements; and the Manner, in which they are made, will fully appear from the Description I am about to give of the said Steps, beginning with the H!!ALF!! C!!OUPEE!!, the Movement that first occurs in _Dancing_.

### {25} CHAP. V.

###  _Of the COUPEE of one Step, or HALF 
    COUPEE._

IT is, first of all, to be observed, that the _Half Coupee_, tho' 
a very agreeable Step in _Dancing_, as well as one of the most 
difficult to be performed well, by Reason of its Plainness, 
is originally nothing more than a single Step, made with either 
Foot, from one Place to another with the additional Orna[-]
ment of a Movement or Bending or Rising of the Knees in 
Time to _Music_; and it is most amiable, when executed in that 
gentle and graceful Manner it ought to be, whether upon the 
Toe or Heel.

The _Half Coupee_ may be perform'd various Ways, as 
by Sinking, Rising, and Stepping forwards; and the like back[-]
wards, sideways, to either Hand, or in turning a quarter or half 
Turn[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate mark'd E]], _&c_. It usually takes up a Time or Measure of the 
Tune, and, being continued, transfers the Weight, as in _Walk[-]
ing_, from one Foot to the other; and, in Distinction from 
the rest, the _Dancing-Masters_ have named it a _Half Coupee_, 
tho' I think it may rather be called a _Coupee of one Step_, as the 
Title above specifies: But, as I shall have Occasion to give a 
farther Account of this Step, when, in treating of the _Bouree_ or 
_Fleuret_, I carry on a Comparison between the Step and the 
_Half Coupee_, I shall, in the mean Time, proceed to the _Coupee_, 
the Movement that next occurs in _Dancing_.

### {26} CHAP. VI. 

###_Of the COUPEE._

THE COUPEE, on the other Hand, is a compound Step; 
that is to say, it is formed of two Steps joined together, 
which, however, are to be accounted but as a single Step: The first 
Movement of which begins in a Sink and Rise. If the Tune, to 
which it is perform'd, be of triple Time (as a _Saraband_, for In[-]
stance, which admits only of three Notes in a Bar) then the 
first Step takes up one of the three Notes, and the other two 
Notes are counted in the remaining Step. The Weight of the 
Body must always rest on the contrary Foot to that, on which 
you begin; so that, if you begin your _Coupee_ with the right 
Foot, the Poise must be on the left[[See the 1st Figure or Man's Side of Plate I]], and continue so to be, 
'till you have compleated the first Step of the two, which, 
as I said, compose the _Coupee_. The first Part being finished, the 
right Foot immediately receives the Weight,[[See the second Figure or Woman's Side in Plate 9]] in the rising from 
the Sink which is made, at commencing the Step, and in the 
same Instant beats Time, as we call it, to the first of the three 
Notes contained in the Bar; supporting the Body[[See the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate I]], whilst the 
left Foot, to compleat this compound Step, slides with a slow 
and gentle Motion, filling up the remaining two Notes of the 
Bar or Measure[[See the 1st Figure or Man's Side in Plate 9]], and the whole Step is compleated, at the In[-]
stant when the left Foot a second time receives the Weight[[See the 1st Figure of Plate 1]]. 
This Step, like the _Half Coupee_, admits of being variously per[-]
formed, {27} as forwards, backwards, sideways, and circularly[[See the Explanation and Table of the Coupee in the Plate mark'd with the Letter E]]. It 
differs, indeed, from the _Half Coupee_, in the Continuance of per[-]
forming it; for whereas the _Half Coupee_, as in _Walking_, transfers 
the Weight, every Time, from one Foot to the other, the _Coupee_ 
does the very Reverse, in that it always begins with the same 
Foot: For, if you begin it with the left Foot, it will end with the 
right; and, if with the right, it concludes on the left[[See the Table and Explanation, as aforesaid, of the Plate of Tables mark'd E]]; and 
so mutually, as often as ever it is repeated, and until it is changed 
by some other Step. It is called a _Coupee_, from its containing two 
Steps instead of one, which is all that the _Half Coupee_ employs.

### CHAP. VII.

###_Of the COUPEE with two Movements._ 

THE _Coupee with two Movements_ is composed, as the 
_Coupee_ I have already explain'd, of two Steps; but it dif[-]
fers in this, that whereas the _Coupee_ treated of before consists 
only of one Movement, that is to say, of one Sink and Rise, 
which is what we call _Movement_, and made to the first Step; 
so it consequently follows, that there must be another Movement 
added to the second, tho' different from the first; for in that 
the Sink is made, before the Foot moves; and the Rise, after 
the Foot has moved, that is to say, when you have made a 
Step, as I have already observed, as in _walking_ either forwards, 
backwards, or sideways, _&c_. but, in this additional Movement, 
the Sink and Rise are together in the Midst of the Motion the 
{28} Leg makes, in stepping, as in the preceding; and supposing the 
Step is to a _Louvre_, or such like slow Air, it is performed in the 
Manner following, _viz._ to make the first Step which is to sink, 
before the Foot moves[[See Plate 1]], and rise in moving, or immediately after 
it has moved[[See Plate 9]]; which said Rising and Receiving of the Weight 
upon the Foot, that made the first Step[[See Plate 1]], marks Time to the 
first Note of the three, which each Bar or Measure contains. 
The second Note is taken up with the Sink of the second Move[-]
ment; and the Rise from it takes up the third Note of the 
same Measure, and compleats the Step; so that the first Move[-]
ment and Step are made to the first Note of the three, and the 
second to the remaining two, and may be performed the dif[-]
ferent Ways aforesaid, as forwards, backwards, sideways before, 
or sideways behind, _&c_.[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in be Plate mark'd E]] and, as to its Continuance in _Danc[-]
ing_, it is the same as the _Coupee of one Movement_, that is, always 
beginning with the same Foot, whether right or left: It is 
named a _Coupee of two Movements_, from its having the Addition 
of a second added to the former; which second Movement is 
made sometimes smooth upon the Floor, and sometimes by 
bounding off.

### {29} CHAP. VIII. 

###_Of the BOUREE-STEP or FLEURET._

THE _Bouree_ is composed of three plain streight Steps 
or Walks, except the first, which begins in a Move[-]
ment, and is to be performed in the same Method, as the 
_Half Coupee_, or _Coupee with two Movements_, that is to say, must 
always sink, at the Beginning of the Step or Walk, and rise 
at, or gradually before the End of it; which is the Manner 
in which the first Step is usually taken, in the Performance of all 
Steps, except _Springs, Bounds, Hops_, or _Chassees, &c._ wherefore, 
for the Future, I need not say any more of the Method of be[-]
ginning these Sorts of Steps, in _Dancing_, otherwise than to make 
a Movement, without mentioning how the Sink and Rise are to 
be made, since they have been already explained.

A _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_, as I have observed, consists only of three 
plain streight Steps; but a Movement is added to the first of 
them, the Rise of which Movement, as has been said, always 
strikes the Cadence or Time; and, if this Step is done to a Tune 
of three Notes in a Measure, the first Step answers to the first 
Note, the second Step to the same Note, and the third Step 
to the last Note of the Measure, concluding together.

You are also to note, that tho' in the _Bouree_ there are three 
distinct Walks or Steps, yet nevertheless, these three Steps are 
to be esteem'd but as one Step, in Regard of its being a com[-]
posed Step; as will appear by the _Half Coupee_, which, tho' no 
more than a single Step, is, however, a Step, because it generally 
takes up a Measure, but more especially in Tunes of triple Time; 
and it is made by a smooth and easy Bending of the Knees, 
Rising in a slow and gentle Motion from thence; which Rising, 
as I have said, is upon the first Note of the Measure, the Weight 
{30} of the Body being supported by the Foot that made the Step, 
during the Counting of the second and third Notes of the Bar.

The graceful Posture of the _Dancer's_ Standing adds not a little 
to the Beauty of this Step, who, 'till the Time be expired, 
is to wait or rest; by which it is evident, that the _Half Coupee_, 
tho' a single Step, is equal, in Value, to any compound Step 
whatsoever, whether of two, three, four, or more Steps in a 
Measure.

But to return, the _Bouree_-Step may be perform'd various Ways, 
as forwards, backwards, sideways, crossing before, the same 
behind, before and behind, behind and before, &c[[See the Explanation and Table of the Bouree in the Plate mark'd E]], the 
Explanation of which, I think, may not be improper, in this 
Place; and therefore I shall proceed to shew the Method of 
their Performance, one after the other, in the Order above set 
down, except the _Fleurets forwards and backwards_; which being 
so intelligible of themselves, and having Occasion hereafter to 
speak of this Step, by way of Grace to the _Minuet_, instead of 
saying any thing farther of them here, I shall begin with the 
_Bouree-Step crossing before, sideways_; which is to be perform'd, as 
follows, either with the right or left Foot: For Instance, pro[-]
vided you begin with the Latter, the Weight must be on the 
right[[See the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate I]]; and the left Foot, which is at Liberty, commences by 
making a Movement and Step, to the right Side of the Room, 
crossing before the Foot on which the Body rests[[See the first Figure in Plate 4, and the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate XI]], the Face 
being to the Upper Part of the Room, and it receives the Weight[[See the first Figure or Man's Side of Plate 5]]. 
The second is the right Foot, which steps the same Way[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 6]]; and the 
third and last, which is with the left, crosses before, as at first[[See the first Figure in Plate 4, and the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate XI]], only without a Movement[[See the first Figure or Man's Side of Plate 5]]. The _Bouree crossing behind, sideways_, 
differs from the Former in this, that whereas that was before, 
this is behind; that is to say, the Weight being, as aforesaid[[See the 2d Figure or Woman's Side of Plate I]], 
{31} the left Foot, instead of making the Movement and first Step 
crossing before the right, it now is made crossing behind it; 
and the next Step, which is with the right Foot, moves the 
same Way, after which the third and last Step with the left Foot 
is drawn behind the right, and concludes. The _Bouree before and 
behind_ is, when the first Movement and Step are made crossing 
before the Foot on which the Weight is, whether right or left, 
the second Step moving sideways, the same Way, and the third 
drawn behind it, facing upwards, as before. The _Bouree behind 
and before_ is done in the like Manner, only the first Step is not 
cross'd before but behind, the second stepping sideways, and 
the third drawn crossing before. The _Bouree_, which I call _twice 
behind_, is made as follows: Suppose, for Example, you make a 
Movement, stepping backwards with the right Foot[[See the 1st Figure of the 1st Plate]], into 
the third Position inclos'd behind the left on which the Weight 
is, and releasing it[[See the 1st Figure of the 4th Plate]]; upon which it makes the second Step 
of the _Bouree_, in a plain Step backwards, receiving the Weight 
inclos'd in the third Position behind the right[[See the 2d Figure of the 4th Plate]], which then 
performs the third Step of the Bouree, in a plain Step for[-]
wards[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 9]].

There are many other Ways of performing this Step, which 
would be too tedious to be mention'd here; and, as they are not 
to my present Purpose, omitting them, I shall only observe, that 
this Step, continued several Measures, changes the Foot, every 
Step, as has been taken Notice of in the _Half Coupee_; but with 
this Difference, that whereas the _Half Coupee_ changes the Weight, 
every single Step, as in _Walking_, the _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_ only changes 
it, at the End of every third Step.

### {32} CHAP. IX. 

###_Of the BOUREE with two Movements._

THE _Bouree with two Movements_ consists of the same Num[-]
ber of Steps, as the former; but as that was of _one Move[-]
ment_, this is of _two_; which second Movement is added to the last 
of the three Steps of which the _Bouree_ is compos'd. This Step, in 
Effect, contains in itself two distinct Steps, namely, the _Whole_ and 
_Half Coupee_; only it is not the same, in the Manner of its Perfor[-]
mance; for they, as was already observed, in treating of them, 
are both equal to a Measure of themselves, but, in this Step, they 
are both to be performed to a Time or Measure, and must be ac[-]
counted only as one Step: For Example, to a Tune of three Notes 
in a Bar, admiting it begins with the right Foot[[See the 1st Figure of Plate the first]], it is to be 
likewise granted, that the Weight must be on the left[[See the 1st Figure of Plate the first]], which 
supports the Body, 'till the first Step and Movement are made[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 9]]; 
the Rise of which Step is to the first of the three Notes belong[-]
ing to the Measure, on which the Weight rests, until the second 
Step is performed, that answers the same Note[[See the 1st Figure in Plate 9]] and ends 
the _Coupee_; whereas the second Step of the _Coupee_ to a Mea[-]
sure takes up the second and third Notes, and consequently is as 
slow again, in its Performance, as this; which third Note of 
the _Coupee_ to a Measure is taken up in this Step with the Rise 
from the _Half Coupee_, and is the third and last Step on which 
the second Movement falls[[See the 2d Figure in Plate 9]], from whence this Step derives its 
Name.

{33} From what has been observed we may see, in what this Step 
differs from the two said Steps before described. In the Conti[-]
nuance of this Step the Weight changes[[See the 2d. Figure in Plate I]], as in the _Bouree with 
one Movement_, and may be perform'd forwards, backwards, side[-]
ways, circularly, _&c_. Note, this Step may be done with a _Bound_, 
that is to say, on the last Step upon which the second Movement 
is made, with a Spring from the Ground, which is what we call a 
_Bound_; and of this I shall take Occasion to say something in its pro[-]
per Place, and give it the Name of _Bouree with a Bound_, as not be[-]
ing made on the Floor, as the _Bouree with two Movements_.

### CHAP. X.

###_Of the PASGRAVE or MARCH._

THE _March_ is originally a single or plain Step, as the _Half 
Coupee_, but different in the Manner of its Performance, in 
that the _Half Coupee_ bends or sinks, before the Step is performed, 
and rises, after it has been made; whereas, on the contrary, in 
this Step, the Movement or bending and Rising are made together, 
as in the second Movement of the _Coupee with two Movements_, 
after which commences a Slide; and the Sink, Rise, and Slide 
compose this Step, which, in its Performance, is as follows: For 
Example, if forwards, the Foot, you design to begin with, is to be 
intirely disengaged from the Weight behind the Foot on which the 
Body rests in the third Position, that is to say, the Ancle of the be[-]
ginning Foot must touch the Heel of the Foot that supports the 
Weight[[See the 1st and 2d Figures in Plate V]]; from which Position this Step always begins and is per[-]
formed by making a Sink and Rise; but instead of stepping for[-]
wards, as in the _Half Coupee_, you rise and point the right or left 
Toe, sideways, according to the Foot you commence with, about 
{34} the Distance from the Foot the Body is upon, as half the Step you 
take in Walking[[See the first and second Figures in Plate VI]].

After this the Foot moves slowly forwards[[See Plate IX]], pressing the Floor, 
as it passes along, about the Length of a Step in _Walking_[[See Plate IX]] which 
Pressing of the Toe or Instep to the Ground, as it moves[[See Plate IX]], is what 
we call a _Slide_ in _Dancing_. And as to its Agreement with the Notes 
of triple Time, as mentioned before, you are to observe, that the 
Rise or Point[[See Plate VI]] marks Time to the first Note; the March or slid[-]
ing forwards of the Foot[[See Plate IX]] takes up the second and third Notes, 
on the Expiration of which it receives the Weight, concluding in 
the third Position, as at first, but on the contrary Foot[[See Plate V]]. This is 
one of the most agreeable Steps in _Dancing_; and it may be perfor[-]
med either forwards, backwards, or sideways, _&c_. and in Perfor[-]
mance, when continued, it transfers the Weight from one Foot to 
another, as in the _Half Coupee_.

### CHAP. XI.

### _Of the POINT and MARCH._

THE _Point_ and _March_ is so call'd from having a _Point_ more 
added to the _March_, which _Point_ is equal, as to its Time, 
with a _March_, and in its Performance the same, except that, in[-]
stead of the second and third Notes being taken up in the marching 
or sliding of the Foot forwards or backwards[[See Plate IX]] _&c_. they are 
counted, during the Time you stand or rest, in the graceful Man[-]
ner before observed in the _Half Coupee_; only with this Difference, 
that the disengaged Foot, instead of being in the first Position, as 
in _that_, is upon the Point _here_, as may be seen by the Beginning or 
first Movement of the foresaid _March_[[See Plate VI]]. The _Point_ is made with either 
{35} Foot, as has been observed in the _March_[[See the Figures in Plate VI]], which _Point_ is per[-]
formed with a soft easy rising from the foregoing Sink[[See Plate V]], made to 
the first Note[[See the Figures in Plate VI]]; in which Posture it remains the counting of the 
second and third Notes of the Measure, concluding what we call 
the _Point_[[See the Figures in Plate VI]], the Body all the while resting upon the same Foot as 
at commencing; after which follows the _March_[[See Plate IX]]; as it has been be[-]
fore described, and the _Point_[[See the Figures in Plate VI]] and March[[See Plate IX]], generally fill up two 
Measures of the Tune, tho' sometimes they are both performed to 
a Measure.

It will not, I think, be here improper to take some Notice, how 
the _Point_[[See the Figures in Plate VI]] and _March_[[See Plate IX]] agree with the Notes of the Measure: 
For Instance, if you make a Movement and Point, sideways, the 
Rise of the Point answers to the first Note[[See the Figures in Plate VI]]; the Rise of the second 
Point or Movement, which immediately ensues upon the same 
Place, on which the first Point was made, marks the second Note[[See the Figures in Plate VI]], 
and the third is counted in the March or Progress of the Foot, ei[-]
ther forwards or backwards from thence[[See Plate IX]]; which are two Me[-]
thods, in which this Step is usually perform'd. But when this Step 
is perform'd to two Measures of the Tune, the Point[[See the Figures in Plate VI]] and Time 
you rest upon it, that is to say, the counting of the second and third 
Notes, whilst you are beautifully standing[[See the Figures in Plate VI]], takes up the first 
Measure. The second is in the March or Slide[[See Plate IX]], and, if continued, 
transfers the Weight every other Step, as in the _Half Coupee_; and 
in fine, as to the Manner of performing this Step, it is fully shewn 
in the _March_, since it is no more than the first Movement, or Sink 
and Rise thereof, on which Rising and Pointing of the Toe or In[-]
step[[See the Figures in Plate VI]], you pause or rest, until the Measure is expired[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate marked E]].

### {36} CHAP. XII.

### _Of the SPRING or BOUND._

THE _Spring_ or _Bound_ is produced from a plain and single Step, 
as the _Half Coupee_, or _March_, but it very much differs from 
them in Performance; for, as they are both made on the Ground, 
the _Bound_ springs off from thence. For Example, suppose you was 
about to perform a _March_, then, instead of sinking and rising on 
the Floor, you are to sink, and, in the Spring or Rise from the 
said Sink, throw the Body into the Air, off from the Foot on which 
the Weight was, when you begun, and light upon the contrary 
Foot; that is to say, if the _Bound_ is on the right, the Weight is to 
come from the left[[See the first and second Figures in Plate V]], where it was upon commencing this Step. 
And in like Manner, if performed with the left Foot[[See the second and first Figures of the foresaid Plate]]. One Bound 
alone rarely, if ever, answers to a Measure; but, in Tunes of com[-]
mon Time, or of four in a Measure, as in _Rigadoons_, _Marches, &c_. 
two _Bounds_ answer a Time; and, in _Sarabands_ or slow Tunes of tri[-]
ple Time, three of them may be done in one Bar.

This Step may be performed various Ways, as forwards, back[-]
wards, sideways before, or sideways behind, as also in turning ei[-]
ther to the right or left, _&c_.[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate marked E]]. And it is farther to be noted, 
that the Foot, on which the _Bound_ is to be made, commences from 
the third Position behind the Foot upon which the Weight rests, as 
in the _March_, and advances, much in the same Manner, from the 
third to the third Position; only that it bounds off from the Ground, 
and if continued to a Tune of common Time, as above, changes 
the Weight twice, in every Measure, and in triple thrice.

### {37} CHAP. XIII.

### _Of the CLOSE or JUMP._

WHAT we call a _Close_ in _Dancing_ is, when, the Weight 
being upon one Foot, we sink, and in the Rise _jump_ or 
_close_ both Feet equal one to the other, in the first Position[[See the Figures in the first and second Plates]], or 
the Feet are inclosed either before or behind, in the third Position[[See the Figures of Plate IV]]; 
and this Step generally concludes in the said Positions or Postures. 
It may be performed two different Ways, _viz._ on the Ground, and 
off from the Ground, as in the _Bound_; but it differs in its Method 
of Performance, for as _that_ advances forwards or backwards, about 
the Length of the _Half Coupee_, or _March_, this never proceeds far[-]
ther than from behind the Foot which supports the Body, either to 
the first Position even, or to the third inclosed before or behind, as 
aforesaid.

I shall, in the first Place, begin with the Description of the _Close_ 
in the first Position, which is as follows: For Instance, the Foot 
that is free from Weight begins whether it be the right or left, in 
making a Movement, or Sink and Rise from the third Position behind[[See the Figures of Plate V - комментарий расположен на другой строке]], 
as when you begin the _March_; that is to say, so far as the _Point_[[See Plate VI]]; 
but, instead of pointing the Toe to the Ground as in that 
here, in rising from the Sink aforesaid, preparing for the _Close_ en[-]
suing, you give a Kind of a Spring upon the Toe or Instep of the 
Foot the Weight is on, and the same Time or Instant both Heels 
come to the Floor together, and receive the Weight equal alike[[See Plate the second]]; but you are to observe, that the Body is thus thrown into the Air 
by the Spring of the Instep, I mean no higher than you can rise 
{38} without quitting the Ground with your Instep or Toe, and from 
hence it is call'd a _Close on the Ground_.

To _close_ in the third Position is perform'd intirely in the same 
Manner, except that, in lighting on both Feet in the first Position 
as before[[See Plate the second. - Данный комментарий отмечен знаком t, которого нет на данной странице, она есть на предыдущей]], the Fall or coming down is in the third; that is to say, 
the Feet are inclosed one before the other, the Heel of the foremost 
Foot touching the Ancle of the hind Foot[[See the Figures in Plate IV]]. In the Performance 
of this Step backwards it is the very same, only, instead of begin[-]
ning from behind the Foot on which the Weight is, it commences 
from before the same, or fourth Position open in the Air[[See the Figures of Plates the IVth, IXth, XIth, XIVth, or XVth]]; so 
that what we have describ'd forwards is to be accomplished back[-]
wards in the same Method: For Example to _close_ backwards in the 
first Position[[See the Figures in the first and second Plates]], or _inclose_ backwards into the third[[See the Figures in Plate IV]], when this 
Step is performed off from the Ground, the Difference is only in 
this, that you sink, in order to spring, as before; but, instead of 
rising to the Extremity or Point of the Toe you only spring quite 
off from the Floor, lighting on both Feet in any of the before men[-]
tioned Positions, whether forwards or backwards, and it is called a 
_Close_ or _Jump_.

You are also to observe, that this Step never advances either for[-]
wards, backwards, or sideways, as is usual in others, but is always 
perform'd upon the same Place; for, altho' the disengaged Foot 
moves from behind or before that on which you stand, the Weight 
always comes down in the same Place: For Instance, suppose you 
was to be in the third Position on the left Foot[[See the first Figure or Man's Side of Plate V]] and to perform 
this Step to the first Position even from behind, the right Foot is 
brought equal to that on which the Weight is, the very Instant the 
_Close_ or _Jump_ is made[[See the first Figure or left Side of Plate I]]; and, if the Fall or coming down be in[-]
closed in the third Position before the Foot[[See the second Figure or Woman's Side of Plate IV]], instead of joining 
even to the Foot on which the Weight is[[See the first Figure or left Side of Plate I]], the Heel of the right 
{39} Foot is inclosed or joined before the Ancle of the left[[See the first Figure or left Side of Plate I]], and the 
same backwards from before.

This Step in _Dancing_ much resembles a _Period_ or full Stop in 
_Letters_; for, as that closes or shuts up a Sentence, the _Close_ in _Dan[-]
cing_ does the very same in _Music_, since nothing is more frequent 
than, at the End of a Strain in the Tune, to find the Strain or Cou[-]
plet of the _Dance_ to conclude in this Step, as also at other remar[-]
kable Places of the _Music_. Besides, this _Close_ gives great Life and 
Variety in the Composition of _Dances_; for whereas most other Steps 
lead the _Dancers_ a regular Figure, and consequently render a 
Change thereof more difficult, in this Step, the Body being as 
much upon one Foot as the other, the Change is more familiar, 
since it is as easy to take up one Foot as the other. This Step ge[-]
nerally takes up a Measure, that is to say, with the Time you rest 
or stand still: For Instance, to a Tune of triple Time the _Close_ is per[-]
formed to the first of the three Notes, and the second and third are 
counted, during the Time you rest; but to Tunes of common 
Time, as _Marches, Gavots, Rigadoons, &c._ this Step and Time it 
is to rest sometimes are a Measure, and at others not, as having 
a plain Step or Walk added thereto, which said Close and Step to[-]
gether fill up the Time.

### CHAP. XIV.

### _Of the SPRING or LEAP._

THE Spring or Leap is the same as the latter End of the fore[-]
going Close or Spring from one Foot upon both, except that the 
Close or Jump always begins from one Foot[[See the Figures of Plate V]], the Weight 
constantly coming down in the same Place[[See the Figures in Plate I]], whereas this Step be[-]
gins {40} and ends upon both Feet[[See the Figure in Plate II]], whether in the first or third Posi[-]
tion[[See the Figure of Plate IV]] and may be performed several Ways, viz. forwards, back[-]
wards, sideways, to the right or left, upright and circularly[[See the Steps in the second Plate and the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked E]]; 
but, when it is performed either of the two latter Ways, the Weight 
comes down in the Place from whence the _Spring_ was made, as in 
the Close aforesaid, tho' in any of the former, as forwards, back[-]
wards, _&c_. they _spring_ or _leap_, about the Length of the _Half 
Coupee_ or _March_, and light on both Feet, as in _Leaping_.

As to the Agreement of this Step with the Notes of the Tune, it 
is uncertain; for to a Tune of three it sometimes takes up a Mea[-]
sure, and at others not: For Example, if you _spring upright_ in this 
Step, the Fall marks what we call the _Time_ or _Cadence_ upon the 
first Note, whilst the other two are counted during the Time you 
rest; and in the like Manner, when it is performed _circularly_ up[-]
on the same Place. _Upright_ and _circularly_ are the two Ways in 
which this Step is performed, when it singly answers to a Bar, as it 
frequently happens on the ending of a Strain or other remarkable 
Part of the Tune; and when it does not, as it rarely, if ever, does in the 
other Ways of performing it, we often meet, instead there of, two Leaps 
and a plain straight Step in a Measure, which together with the two 
Springs agree with the Notes of the _Music_; and many Times we find a 
third Spring added, instead of the plain straight Step; which three 
Springs agree with the Notes, as before, tho' they are seldom used 
except in _Comic Dancing_ and Tunes of common Time, that is to 
say, of four in the Bar, as in _Gavots, Marches, Rigadoons_, _&c_. in 
which this _Spring_ or _Leap_ on both Feet is the same, in its answering 
with the Notes of the Tune, except that, instead of two Springs and 
the plain straight Step to a Measure, or the three Springs, as in 
triple Time, in these of common there is but one Close and the 
straight Step; and also, instead of three Springs or Leaps, here are 
but two, which Steps agree with the Notes, as follows: The Fall or 
{41} Coming down of the Weight from the first Spring beats Time to 
the first Note of the Bar; and the second and third Notes are count[-]
ed, during the Performing of the plain Step. The fourth Note is 
always taken up with the Sink which prepares for the succeeding 
Step; and consequently it is very necessary to take Notice, that the 
two Leaps are performed in the same Method. The Coming down 
of the first Spring, as I said before, marks the Time or first Note; 
the Sinking or Bending of the Knees, in order for the second Rise 
or Spring, answers the same Note; and the third is in the Coming down 
of the Weight in the Sink, _&c_. as was just observed, which Step, if 
continued, is a sort of an harmonious Leaping to _Music_ either for[-]
wards or backwards, _&c_.[[See the Table of the Leap or Jump, in the Plate marked E or second Plate]]. It is to be likewise noted, that the 
_upright Spring_ or _Close_ affords the _Dancer_ the like Opportunity of 
changing the Foot, during the Time of resting as in the foregoing 
_Close_, the Difference being only in its beginning and ending on 
both Feet; and, if performed on the Ground, it is intirely in the 
same Manner, as we have already described it in the _Jump_ or _Close_ 
from one Foot.

### CHAP. XV.

### _Of the RIGADOON STEP of one Spring open 
    in the same Place and Close._

THE _Rigadoon Step_ of one Spring open upon the same Place is 
composed of two plain Steps or Motions of the Feet, except 
that the first commences with a _Spring_ or _Hop_; which said Spring 
and plain Step is to a Measure, and introduces the _upright Spring_ or 
_Close_ on both Feet, before treated of, to another Measure in its At[-]
tendance on the former, from which it is almost inseparable; inso[-]
much {42} that the said _Rigadoon Step_ is seldom, if ever, without this 
_Close_ following it, as adding the greatest Grace and Beauty thereto, 
and being from thence so strictly united that, altho' in themselves 
they are two distinct Steps, the first never appears but concludes in 
the latter which in its Performance is as follows, viz. commencing 
from the first Position, or the Feet join'd even one with the other, 
from whence the Sink or Preparative for the _Hop_ is taken, and 
may be done with either Foot. However, for the better Under[-]
standing thereof I shall describe it, with the right Foot: Therefore, 
as has been already observed, the Weight being on both Feet in the 
first Position[[See the Figure in Plate II, only instead of facing down the Room you may suppose it looking to the Presence]], you sink and give a Rise or Spring, either off from 
the Ground, or upon it, as you shall think most agreeable, since 
it may be perform'd both Ways; which said Spring is made upon 
the left Foot, in rising from the aforesaid Sink, by taking the 
right Foot up from the Floor, the very same Instant the Spring or 
_Hop_ is made, and moves open off to the right Side of the Room, if 
to the upper End, or otherwise according to what Part of the Room 
the Body is directed in the Air, about the Length of a Step in _Dan[-]
cing_[[See in some Measure the Feet in the second Figure of Plate XV]]; and then it returns to the first Position from whence it came 
receiving the Weight; upon which the left Foot, being now disen[-]
gaged, moves open sideways in the like Manner[[See the Feet in the first Figure of Plate XV]], and, in re[-]
turning, receives one half of the Weight in the same Position as at 
first[[See the Figure in Plate II, only instead of facing down the Room you may suppose it looking to the Presence]]; after which comes the Close on both Feet[[See Plate II]] which some[-]
times is to a Measure, and at others not, in that there often follows 
in _Rigadoon_ Movements, a plain Step or Walk in the Time or Mea[-]
sure, as for Example, you'll find in this Movement of the _Bretagne_; 
that is to say, the Beginning of the second Part is the very same Step 
I have here described.

As to the Agreement of this Step with the Notes of the Tune, 
which is of four in the Measure, the Spring, or Hop, that is made 
{43} upon the left Foot, on the taking up of the right, marks the Time 
or first Note; the setting of it down the second; the third is in the 
setting down of the left Foot; and the fourth and last Note, in the 
Sink for the ensuing Close that attends this Step, which together 
compose one of the most agreeable Steps in _Dancing_.

There are, besides these already described, many other Ways of 
performing this Step, as in the third Position forwards, and the same 
backwards; but, for the better Understanding of this, suppose you 
are standing in the first Position, or the Feet are joined even to each 
other[[See the Figure in Plate II, supposed to be looking up the Room]], you perform this Step into the third Position, that is, 
you make the first Step which is with a Spring, and inclose it before 
the Foot on which the Weight rests[[See the second Figure of Plate IV]], and the second before that[[See the first Figure of Plate IV]] 
in the like Manner.

To perform this Step backwards differs in this, that as the fore[-]
going was inclosed before, after the Spring, this is inclosed behind the 
Foot that supports the Weight[[See the first Figure of the said Plate IV]], and the second Step behind that[[See the second Figure of Plate IV]]; 
or elfe the first of the said two Steps, namely, the _Spring_, may be 
done in the third Position before[[See the two first or inclosed Feet of Plate IV]], and the second behind[[See the two first or inclosed Feet of Plate IV]]; or 
the first with a Spring behind[[See the hindmost Feet in Plate IV]], and the second Step before[[See the inclosed Feet in Plate IV]], 
and are to be performed from either of the said Positions, whether 
the first or third, as is also the _Spring_ or _Close_ that follows them, 
whether upright or changing of the Position; that is, instead of co[-]
ming down in the first, or in the third, as at Beginning, the Feet 
are changed, for Instance, the first last, and the last first[[See the Table and Explanation of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked E]].

### {44} CHAP. XVI. 

### _Of the RIGADOON Step of two Springs 
    or SISSONNE._

THE _Rigadoon_ Step with two Springs differs from the former 
of one in this, that whereas the aforesaid is performed in the 
same Place, and only with one Spring, this is of two; the first of 
which advances or retires, about the Length of a March, whilst 
the second Spring is in the same Place upon one Foot.

This Step may also be perform'd sideways crossing before, or 
sideways crossing behind, either to the right or left, or turning[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked E]], 
_&c_. the Difference of which, in the Manner of Performance, I 
shall describe in their Order. For Example, first _forwards_, which 
may be done with one Foot as well as the other; yet, for the more 
easy comprehending thereof, I intend to explain it, beginning with 
the right Foot, which is as follows, _viz_. the Weight is on the left 
in the third Position, and the right behind; that is to say, the An[-]
cle of the right Foot rests against the Heel of the left, but is intirely 
free from any Weight of the Body[[See the first Figure of Plate V]]; from whence you make the 
first Spring which is upon the left Foot, whilst the right, at the 
same Instant, moves directly the same Way, as in the _March_, ex[-]
cept that the _March_ is performed on the Ground from a Bend and 
Rise only, but this off from thence, by an upright Spring into the 
Air from the Sink you make upon your left Foot, on which the 
Weight falls in the same Place, the right advancing, as has been al[-]
ready observed, about the Length of a _March_; but it does not re[-]
ceive the whole Weight of the Body, as in that, by Reason of its 
continuing principally on the same Foot on which it was, at com[-]
mencing; {45} so that, altho' the right Foot is advanced before the o[-]
ther, it receives no more than its own Weight, the whole being to 
follow on making the second Spring[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]]. Having thus far only 
concluded the first Spring or Movement, the second is made from 
the aforesaid Position divided; that is to say, the right Foot is, near 
the Length of a Step in _Dancing_, before the left; in which Posi[-]
tion or Posture both Knees bend, the right to receive the Body, and 
the left to be disengaged from it, as it intirely is on giving the 
Hop or Spring; for, at the Instant the Foot on which the Weight 
was, is taken from the Floor, the other receives it, ending the Step 
in the third Position upon the right Foot, the left being behind 
but free from any Weight; the Ancle of which rests against the 
Heel of the Foot that supports the Body, in the same Position in 
which it begun, only with the contrary Foot[[See the second Figure of Plate V]], and may be con[-]
tinued from one Foot to the other, as in the _March, &c._

This Step _backwards_ is performed in the like Manner as _forwards_ 
except that _forwards_ it is taken from the third Position behind, but 
in this begins from the same Position before; that is, the Heel of 
the right Foot touches the Ancle of the left on which the Body 
rests[[See the second Figure of Plate IV]], from whence you make the Spring in the same Method 
already described in this Step _forwards, viz_. the right and fore[-]
most Foot, at the same Moment the Spring is given upon the 
left, moves backwards, as in the _March_, much about the like 
Distance, and receives half the Weight, at the same Time the other 
half comes down upon the left, leaving the Weight divided to the 
first Spring or Hop[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate IX, or second Figure in Plate XI]]; and the second is made on the right Foot, 
in the taking up of the left, which falls inclosed in the third Position as at beginning except that the contrary Foot is foremost[[See the first Figure in Plate IV]], 
and the left is ready to commence, as before. This Step _Side[-]
ways crossing before_ is so called, from its being crossed before the 
Foot on which the Weight of the Body rests, and it chiefly differs 
from the two Ways already described namely, _forwards_ and _back[-]
wards_, {46} in that it begins from the third Position behind, as aforesaid[[See the first Figure of Plate V]], 
but instead of the right Foot's moving, as in them, you in this give 
the Spring and Fall in the fifth Position, the right or beginning 
Foot crossing before the left, the Weight being divided, as before; 
that is, the Heel of the right Foot is equal to the Toe of the left[[See the Feet of the first Figure in Plate XI]], 
which Manner of placing the Feet we call the _fifth Position_. The 
second Spring or Hop is made upon the right Foot on the taking 
up the left, which is then brought into the third Position behind, 
and the right Foot into the same Position as the beginning but con[-]
trary Foot[[See the second Figure of Plate V]]; which said Foot is ready to perform the same Thing 
either _sideways crossing before_ the right on which the Body is, or 
_sideways crossing behind_, the latter of which I shall explain, in the 
next Place, and it is as follows.

_Sideways crossing behind_ varies from the former only in this, that, 
instead of commencing from the third Position behind, it begins 
from before: For Example, the Weight being upon the left Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]] 
you sink and make the first Spring with the right, falling in the fifth 
Position crossing behind; that is, the Toe of the right Foot is equal 
to the Heel of the left, the Weight being divided, as has been al[-]
ready explained[[See the Feet in the second Figure of Plate XI]]. The second Spring is performed upon the 
right, on the left's being taken up from the Ground, as aforesaid, 
which falls inclosed in the third Position before; that is, the Heel of 
the left Foot is joined to the Ancle of the right, and, being disen[-]
gaged from Weight, is at Liberty to perform the same with the left 
Foot, as we have described with the right[[See first Figure of Plate IV]].

Having now shewn, how this Step is performed _sideways cros[-]
sing before_, as also the same _behind_, it is unnecessary here to take 
any farther Notice of this Step _sideways to the right_, than that it dif[-]
fers in Nothing from what we have described _to the left_ but in the con[-]
trary Foot; nor likewise of the Manner of its Performance in _turn[-]
ing_, {47} otherwise than that it may be performed several Ways, as to 
the right or left, in a quarter Turn, half Turn, or three quarter 
Turn, _&c_. since I shall take Occasion hereafter, in the ensuing 
Steps, to treat more particularly on that Head. I shall only ob[-]
serve at present, that those who learn to _dance_, and are acquainted 
with the _Rigadoon_ of the late Mr. Isaac, will meet with this Step, 
_turning_ in all or most of the Ways above mentioned, in the 
different Parts thereof; and it is here, for Distinction sake, named 
of _two Springs_.

There is still another Way in which this Step is often made, and 
not as yet observed, which is the Reverse in the second Spring 
to the foregoing; for, instead of taking up, in the second Spring, 
the Foot on which the Body was, when you begun, the contrary 
Foot or that Foot which advances or retires is taken up: For In[-]
stance, admitting this Step to begin with the right Foot, of Conse[-]
quence the Weight must then be upon the left, from whence you 
make the first Spring, as is usual, upon both Feet; but, instead of 
the left Foot's being taken from the Floor, as in the aforesaid, the 
right or beginning Foot is taken up on making the second Spring; 
which Choice of Feet in this Step renders it of equal Use, in the 
Composition of _Dances_, as the _Close_, in that the Change of Figure 
is to be effected in this, as well as in the aforesaid.

Having described most of the different Manners of performing 
this Step in _Dancing_, I shall proceed to shew its Agreement with 
the Notes of this Movement, which, as we have already said, is of 
four in the Bar, and it agrees as follows: The first Spring is made 
upon the Time or first Note; the Sink for the second is in 
the second Note, which second Spring is performed to the 
third Note; and the fourth is in the Sink preparing for the suc[-]
ceeding Step. And, when it is done to a _Saraband_ or Tune of 
triple Time, it is in all Respects the same, except that, instead of 
four Notes in a Bar, in this you have only three, which are, in 
their Performance, much slower than the before mentioned of four 
to the Measure; and it is farther to be observed, that one half of 
the third Note is borrowed for the Sink that prepares for the ensuing 
{48} Step, in which it chiefly differs from the foregoing of common 
Time, but that it is not so brisk.

### CHAP. XVII.

### _Of the GALLIARD and FALLING Step._

THE _Galliard_ Step is in a Manner the same, as the befor[[видимо, опечатка]] de[-]
scribed _Close_ from one Foot to both, except that in this the 
Weight of the Body, after making the Spring or Movement for the 
_Close_, remains on the same Foot upon which it was at the Begin[-]
ning; from whence it follows, that the Foot which, in the fore[-]
going _Close_, received one half of the Weight, is here to be disen[-]
gaged, and at Liberty to perform the succeeding one which is a 
plain straight Step or Walk; which Step could not have been per[-]
formed with the commencing Foot, had it received one half of the 
Weight, as in the _Close_ from one Foot. And you are to note, that 
this Step always ends with the same Foot it begins, whether it be 
the right or left, and is various, as to its Performance in _Dancing_. 
I shall describe the most usual of these Ways, which are as follow 
_viz_. forwards, backwards, sideways to the right or left, and also 
in turning a quarter Turn, half Turn, _&c_.[[See the Explanation and Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked E. and Plate VII]] and, in all the a[-]
foresaid Methods of performing the _Galliard_ Step, the _Falling_ Step 
rarely, if ever, fails to accompany it, in that they are inseparable, 
in their Performance, as the R!!IGADOON!! Step open in the same 
Place of one Spring and upright _Close_ upon both Feet we have be[-]
fore described, tho' they are two distinct Steps in themselves. 
However, sometimes, instead of the _Galliard_ Step, we find the 
_Coupee_ crossing before sideways introducing the _Falling_ Step; 
which it does very naturally, their Endings being directly alike.

{49} Now, as to the Method of performing the _Galliard_ Step which, 
as I have said in the Description thereof, is compounded of a _Close_ 
and plain straight Step or Walk, I shall begin with the right Foot 
advancing forwards, in the following Manner, _viz_. the Weight of 
the Body is upon the left Foot in the third Position, and the right 
disengaged behind[[See the first Figure of Plate V]]; from whence you sink and give an upright 
Spring upon the left Foot, closing the right or hindmost Foot equal 
to it directly the same Way as has been described in the _Close_ from 
one Foot to both, except with this Difference that, as I have said, 
the before mentioned lights on both Feet, but this comes down on[-]
ly upon one, namely the left; and it varies from the aforesaid, the 
right Foot being in the first Position, joined even with the left, and 
at Liberty to perform the following plain straight Step[[See the first Figure of Plate I]], which 
together with the foregoing _Close_ compleats the _Galliard Step_; 
that is to say, after the plain straight Step has been made forwards 
with the right Foot, about the Length of a Step in _Walking_, it 
does not bring up the left equal to it, as in that, but leaves it in 
the same Place, whilst the Weight of the Body advances forwards 
with the stepping of the right Foot, the End or setting to the Floor 
of which receives the Weight; so that, as I have just observed, the 
left Foot is upon the Point behind, the like Distance, and the right 
advanced from it, in which Posture the _Galliard Step_ concludes[[See the second Figure in Plate VII]]. 
Upon this commences the _Falling Step_, which is performed in the 
following Manner, _viz_. the Weight of the Body ending in the 
_Galliard Step_ upon the right, the left Foot is pointed behind; at 
the same Time the Body bends or bows forwards, in order to the 
ensuing _Fall_ which is backwards, but is prevented in it by the left 
Foot, which was planted for that Purpose upon the Point behind; 
and, at the very Instant the Weight of the Body inclines forwards 
preparing for the _Fall_, the left is advancing up to prevent it; 
which it does by receiving the falling Weight in a Sink or Bend 
of the Knee, in the third Position inclosed behind, releasing the 
{50} right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plates IV and XIV]], which is then ready to receive the Weight, on the 
Spring that is given from the left, immediately after its receiving 
the aforesaid falling Weight, and comes down upon the right Foot 
again, in the Nature of a latter Part of the _Balonne_, of which more 
hereafter; concluding in the same Position from whence the fore[-]
going _Galliard_ Step was taken, with the contrary Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate V]] and, in 
continuance together with the _Galliard_ Step, it changes the Foot, 
as in the _Half Coupee_, or _March_, _&c_.

In performing this Step _sideways_, either to the right or left, it 
only differs from the former in the plain Step, which, instead of 
being made, as in the aforesaid _forwards_, is here performed _side[-]
ways_; and it may easily be understood by comparing it with the 
foregoing described, advancing to the upper Part of the Room: 
for Instance, supposing the Close to be made in the first Position, 
as before, the right Foot, instead of making the plain straight Step 
as in that, here makes it _sideways_ to the right Hand, in like Man[-]
ner as _forwards_. That is, the End or Setting down of the plain 
straight Step receives the Body; leaving the left Toe upon the Point 
sideways the like Distance from the right on which the Weight is, 
as has been shewn in this Step _forwards_, when the said Toe was 
left pointed behind, as it now is _sideways_; from whence commen[-]
ces the _Falling_ Step, which, instead of forwards, as before, is made 
as follows, _viz_. the Weight being on the right Foot, and the 
left Toe upon the Point[[See the first Figure in Plate VI. or Plate XV]], as was already observed, the Weight 
of the Body falls to the right Hand, but, as I have said, is preven[-]
ted; for, at the same Time the Weight falls, the left Foot which 
was upon the Point is brought with a swift Motion to its Relief, 
crossing behind the right on which the falling Weight is in the 
fifth Position, receiving the Body[[See the first Figure in Plate XI]] which must otherwise have 
fallen, and releases the right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate XIV]] which immediately receives 
the Weight again, in a _Bound_ or _Balonne_ sideways to the Hand the 
{51} Fall was on, in that the left no sooner receives the falling Weight 
in a Sink or bended Knee, than it gives a Spring, in rising, and 
throws the Body, as in bounding back, upon the right Foot, con[-]
cluding the _Falling_ Step in the third Position, with the left upon 
the Point behind, instead of the right, as at first[[See the second Figure in Plate V]]; from whence 
the said _Galliard_ and _Falling_ Step may be performed to the left 
Hand, in like Manner as the foregoing to the right, the Difference 
being only in the contrary Foot, Examples of which with both 
Feet begin the second Strain of the _Rigadoon_ Part of a _Dance_, na[-]
med the _Bretagne_, the first Time of its playing over, for they are 
the very same Steps here treated of.

These Steps may also be made with a quarter Turn, or a half 
Turn, _&c_. which, to give a more perfect Idea thereof, I shall ex[-]
plain with the left Foot, as follows, _viz_. the Weight being upon 
the right in the third Position, the left upon the Point behind[[See the second Figure in Plate V]] 
begins, in making the Spring or Close in the first Position as afore[-]
said only, instead of the Presence looking up the Room after the 
Close, it now faces to the right Side, which is a quarter of a Turn, 
and in this it differs from the two Ways last described; but the re[-]
maining Part of the Step is intirely the same, stepping the begin[-]
ning Foot sideways to the left Hand, and facing to the right Side of 
the Room, as before to the upper. The _Falling_ Step is also the same 
as before except, as I have said, in not facing to the same Part of 
the Room; and turning a half Turn only differs in this, that the first 
Spring or Close, instead of ending in a quarter of a Turn to the 
right, as before, continues a quarter Turn more, facing to the Bot[-]
tom of the Room, the left Foot stepping sideways to the same 
Hand, as aforesaid, _&c_.

As to the Agreement of these Steps with the Notes of the _Music_, 
it is much the same as in the others: For Example, in the follow[-]
ing Tunes, as _Forlanes, Jigs, &c._ the Close is made to the first 
Note; the second and third are counted in the straight Step of 
the _Galliard_, that is to say, the second Note, at the Beginning of 
{52} the[[слово повисло между страниц]] said Step, and the third, at its ending or receiving the Weight of 
the Body. And, suppose instead of performing this Step with a 
plain straight Step, as in _Walking_, you add thereto a Sink and a 
Rise, the Sink then answers the second Note, and the Rise the 
third; and in the succeeding Step the Fall of the Body marks the 
first Note, the Pause or Rest the Weight makes upon the Knees 
bent the second, and the third is in the contrary Foot's receiving 
the Body upon the Spring or Bound given from the Foot which 
preserved the Weight from falling, where ends the second Measure 
or Time. When these Steps are performed to Tunes of common 
Time, as they for the most Part are in _Galliards_, _Bourees_, _Riga[-]
doons_, _&c._ they are intirely the same as in triple, only, instead of 
borrowing half the third Note for the Sink in common Time, the 
Sink or Preparative for beating the Time is upon the fourth Note, 
as has been shewn in the _Rigadoon_ Step of two Springs; and the most 
usual Manner of performing this Step is in a soft and gentle Move[-]
ment upon the Floor, tho' it may be done to Advantage either Way, 
_viz._ off from the Ground, or upon it.

### _Of the BOUREE with a BOUND._

THE _Bouree with a Bound_, so called from its having a _Bound_ 
added to the _Bouree_, is a compound Step consisting of four 
plain Steps and two Movements, the first whereof is made upon 
the Ground, but the other not: For Instance, you make a Move[-]
ment or Sink and Rise to the first of the four Steps, the second and 
third compleating the _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_; and the fourth and last is 
a _Bound_ which is always performed off from the Floor, as we have 
already shewn, in treating of that Step.

I shall now proceed to shew, how these four Steps are to be re[-]
duced to agree with the Notes of triple Time or of three in the 
{53} Measure, which may be accomplished, as follows, _viz_. the left 
Foot, with which we shall for Example begin, and the right are to 
be performed in a Motion as swift again, as the remaining two Steps, 
by reason they are both to be accounted but as one Note, and are 
made to the first of the Measure. The third Step, which is with 
the left Foot, is to the second Note, upon which the _Bouree_ con[-]
cludes; and the fourth Step is a _Bound_ with the right Foot to 
the third Note, and compleats the _Bouree with a Bound_. This 
Step continued in _Dancing_, whether it be the right or the left, al[-]
ways begins with the same Foot, as has been already observed in the 
_Coupee_, and may be performed forwards, backwards, sideways to 
either Hand, crossing before, crossing behind, or crossing before 
and behind in the same Measure, or twice behind; and they are all 
of them directly the same, in their Manner of Performance, as 
was shewn in the _Bouree of one Movement_, only, as that was but 
of three Steps and one Movement to a Bar, this is of four and 
two Movements; and consequently, instead of performing the first 
two Steps equally slow, as in them, they must be quick here, in 
that they are both to be accounted as no more than one Step, as I 
have said; and as the _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_ breaks off, at the End of the 
third Step which is upon the left Foot, the Bound must be added 
thereto with the right, which is the only Difference from the _Bou[-]
ree_ aforesaid. It is unnecessary to say any thing farther of these 
Steps, in this Place, since they will be understood by what has been 
said in the _Bouree_ or _Fleuret of one Movement_, having in that de[-]
scribed all the different Ways mentioned here; but only to observe, 
that the first two Steps, as above, and the Bounds must be added.

### {54} CHAP. XIX. 

### _Of the SLIP before and then behind, or SLIP 
    behind and afterwards before, and HALF 
    COUPEE sideways._

THE _Slip before and then behind_ is a Step composed of four 
plain Steps, in a Measure, and two Movements; which 
said Movements may be done upon the Ground, or off from thence; 
but it differs from the _Bouree_ with a Bound in this, that, whereas, 
in the _Bouree_ aforesaid, the first Movementis always to be made 
on the Floor, and the second off, in this Step both are performed 
alike, either springing from the Ground, or upon it; and it is also 
to be noted, that these Steps seldom, if ever, are performed any o[-]
therwise than sideways to the right or left Hand, or with a quarter 
Turn, half Turn, _&c_.

These are the Ways this Step is usually made, as either _slipping 
before and afterwards behind_, or _slipping behind and then before_; 
the first of which I shall describe, beginning with the right Foot. 
For Example, the Weight of the Body is upon the left Foot in the 
third Position, the right being intirely disengaged from the Weight, 
so that it may be at Liberty to begin[[See the first Figure in Plate V]]; which it does by making 
the first Movement or Bend and Rise from behind the left Foot to 
the first of the four Steps, stepping open off sideways to the right 
Hand[[See the Point or second Figure of Plate VI]], and the second Step, which is with the left Foot, is 
drawn crossing before it,[[See the Point or first Figure in Plate VI. and second Figure of Plate XI]] after which the right Foot makes 
{55} the second Movement the same Way, which is the third Step; 
but, instead of the left and last Foot's being drawn before, as in 
the first _Slip_[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], it must now be drawn behind where it concludes 
receiving the Weight in the fifth Position[[See the first Figure in Plate XI]].

_To Slip behind and then before_ is, when the right Foot has made 
the first Movement and Step sideways in the Manner just described; 
and the second Step, which is with the left Foot,[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]] instead of be[-]
ing drawn crossing before, as in the former, is drawn behind[[See the first Figure of Plate XI]]. 
The second Movement is also with the right Foot, stepping to the 
same Side[[See the second Figure in Plate VI]], which is the third Step; and the fourth and last, 
which is with the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]], is drawn crossing before the right in[-]
to the Position aforesaid[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]].

To perform this Step with a quarter of a Turn, either to the right 
or left Hand, is only turning a quarter Turn to one of the said 
Hands, as it shall fall out; in Dancing however, as an Example, I 
shall explain it sideways to the right Hand, facing to the left Side 
of the Room, _viz. before and behind_, and _behind and before_, which 
are both to be performed, as follows: For Instance, these _Slips_, as 
before described, were sideways, facing the upper End of the Room 
to the right Hand; whereas, in a quarter Turn to the left Side of 
the Room, in the Sink of the first Movement, you prepare for the 
Rise or Beating Time; but instead performing it, facing to 
the upper End of the Room, as in the foregoing, in the rising, it 
makes a quarter of a Turn to the left Hand, which then will face 
to the left Side of the Room; yet in the Performance of the rest of 
the Step to the right, it is intirely in the same Manner as I have ex[-]
plained it, to the upper Part of the Room, there being no Diffe[-]
rence except in the Turn.

A half Turn is the same as the quarter; only that, in the Rise of 
the first Movement, which is made with the right Foot, instead of 
{56} turning a quarter Turn as before, that is, facing the left Side of the 
Room, in this you make a half Turn, which then faces the Bot[-]
tom of the Room, performing the rest of the Step to the right 
Hand, in the same Manner we have described it to the upper End.

These Steps may likewise be done, both _slipping behind_, or both 
_slipping before_; the former is, when, in making the Movement to 
the right or left Side, the second Step, which is the _Slip_, is drawn 
crossing behind the first or beginning Foot; and the second Move[-]
ment and _Slip_ are performed in the like Manner.

Both _slipping before_ is, when, in performing the said Movements, 
the Foot, which makes the _Slips_, is both Times drawn crossing be[-]
fore the Foot which begun, that is, the second and fourth Steps; 
and the first of these Steps, namely, _twice slipping behind_, is in the 
_Rigadoon_ of the late Mr _Isaac_, where, in the Beginning of the Tune, 
the second Time of playing over, it forms a perfect Square, which 
is no small Addition to the Beauty of the said _Dance_; and this Step 
_slipping before_ is no less remarkable, in that it is frequently met 
with in _Dancing_.

This Step, in all the different Ways of performing it, as above 
described, is seldom, if ever, without the _Half Coupee_ sideways 
following it, on the same Hand to which the _Slips_ were made, 
which seem not to have received their utmost Perfection, without 
this Step attending them; and as the Slips, before explained, were 
to the right Hand, this must be so likewise, and consists of one 
plain Step, as has been observed, in treating of the _Half Coupee_; 
to which is added a Movement or Sink and Rise, made with the 
right Foot stepping open off, sideways, from the Position in which 
the foregoing Slips ended, receiving the Weight on the setting of 
the Toe or Heel to the Floor[[See the second Figure in Plate VI]]; after which the left Foot makes 
a Motion in the Air, in the Form of a half Circle, before the An[-]
cle {57} of the right Foot, opening to the left Hand, and accomplishes 
the Time or Measure[[See the first Figure in Plates XIV. and XV]].

It still remains to shew, how these Steps agree with the Notes of 
common or triple Time; for they are very different in their Man[-]
ner of Performance, which we shall proceed to explain, and chiefly in 
this, that in Tunes of triple Time either the first or second Slip, 
instead of being made quick as in Tunes of common Time, are as 
slow again; yet, for the farther Illustration of this Point, I shall 
observe, how these Steps agree with the Notes both of common and 
triple Time; which is as follows: To common Time or of four in 
the Bar, as in _Rigadoons, Bourees, &c._ But having already descri[-]
bed the Motion or Stepping of the Feet, I shall wave the saying 
any Thing farther of it here, and only shew, that the first _Slip_ or first 
and second Steps are to be performed in the same swift Manner 
we have shewn, in the Beginning or two first Steps of the _Bouree 
and a Bound_, and are both to be made upon the first of the four 
Notes. The second Note is counted in the Sink which prepares 
for the second _Slip_, which is the third and fourth Steps; the Rise 
which is made on the setting down of the third Step, or Beginning 
of the last _Slip_, beats Time to the third Note, which said _Slip_ is 
compleated in the Sound of the third Note, in the same Manner as 
the first Movement to the first Note; and the fourth and last Note 
is counted in the Sink which prepares for the ensuing Step.

When this Step is performed to a Tune of triple Time or of 
three Notes in the Measure, as in _Sarabands_, _Louvres_, _Passacailles_, 
_&c_. sometimes the first _Slip_ is quick, as in the aforesaid, and the 
second not; and at other Times the first is slow, and the second swift. 
When the Movement is made quick, it is performed, as above, to 
the first of the three Notes; the second, which is slow, takes up 
the second and third Notes. For Instance, as was already said, the 
first _Slip_ or _Coupee_ being made with the first and second Steps to 
the first Note, the second _Slip_, which begins with the third Step, is to 
the second Note; and the third is taken up in the gentle sliding or 
drawing of the fourth and last Step, whether before or behind.
{58}Half the third Note is borrowed, tomark the Sink which is for 
the next Step, as has been observed before; and, if the first _Slip_ is 
slow, the beginning Step is to the first Note, the _Slip_ or easy drawing 
of the second Step behind or before to the second Note, and the re[-]
maining _Slip_ is swift to the third Note.

As to the _Half Coupee_, the first Movement or stepping sideways 
marks Time to the first Note; the second and third are counted in 
the half Circle the Foot makes in the Air; and the fourth in the 
Sink, provided it be common Time; but, if triple, half the third 
Note is borrowed, as I have said. 

### CHAP. XX.

### _Of the HOP or CONTRETEMP._

THE _Hop_ or _Contretemp_ is a compound Step consisting of two 
Walks or Steppings of the Feet, as the _Coupee_; and it may be 
performed various Ways, as advancing, retiring, sideways to the 
right or left, turning, _&c_. There are also two different Positions from 
whence this Step is taken and performed, namely, the third and 
fourth; the first of which we shall explain forwards, beginning 
with the left Foot, which is behind the right in the third Position[[See the second Figure in Plate V]], 
but so disengaged from the Weight of the Body as to be ready to 
act; which it does in the Sink that prepares for the _Spring_ or _Hop_ 
which is made upon the right Foot, lighting in the same Place; and 
at the Instant the _Hop_ or Rise from the Ground is given, it leaves 
the aforesaid Position where it rested, during the Sink, and 
straightens the Knee, pointing the Toe directly sideways, as in the 
_March_[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, or first Figure of Plate XV]]; but it does not press upon the Floor, as in that, by Rea[-]
son the _March_ is performed upon the Ground, and this off from 
thence which is the principal Difference; for, instead of the Pro[-]
gress made by the disengaged Foot, as in the _March_, in this it 
{59} must be performed in like Manner off from thence in the Air, the 
Weight all the while continuing on the same Foot upon which 
it was at commencing, 'till the left has advanced the Length of a 
_March_ or Step in Walking[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]; after which it receives the Body, 
and releases the right Foot that supported it, during its Procession, 
as aforesaid, which then makes a plain Step or Walk forwards[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]], 
which is the second Step of the _Contretemp_, and is compleated on 
the setting down or receiving of the Weight upon the said Foot in 
the Position as at first[[See the second Figure in Plate V, as aforesaid]], being a Sort of _Hopping Coupee_.

To perform this Step _backwards_ is intirely the same as _forwards_, 
only, instead of the left Foot's being in the third Position behind, 
the right is now inclosed before in the same or fourth Position[[See the first Figure in Plate IV, or first Figure in Plate IX]], 
from whence it makes the _Spring_ or _Hop backwards_, in the same 
Manner as was described _forwards_[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, or first Figure of Plate XV aforesaid]]; after which the right Foot, 
instead of stepping forwards, as before, in this makes the second 
Step backwards[[See the second Figure of Plate IX, and for the second Step of the Contretemp the first Figure in the same Plate concluding as at first. See the first Figure in Plate IV]].

When this Step is done with a quarter or half Turn, _&c_. the 
Weight of the Body, as has been observed, being on the right Foot, 
the _Hop_ or _Contretemp_ is performed, as we have already explain[-]
ed, but not to the upper End of the Room, instead of which it 
turns a Quarter of a Turn to the right Hand; but the rest is the 
same, as in the foregoing, only you are to observe, that it is 
facing to the right Side of the Room to which it advances.

The half Turn in no Respect differs from the former, except in 
its not stopping at the right Side of the Room; but, instead of 
that, it adds a Quarter more facing to the lower End of the Room, 
to which it is performed in like Manner, as above, to the upper; 
and if, instead of the right Hand, it be performed to the left, as it 
equally is in turning, as aforesaid, it is much the same, except 
that the quarter or half Turn, instead of being made to the right 
{60} Hand, as in the foregoing, are now advancing to the left Side or 
Bottom of the Room; of which the _Royal George_ affords us an Ex[-]
ample, in that the said _Dance_ begins with this Step, both to the 
right and left Hands, _viz_. the _Gentleman_ performs it to the left 
Hand here spoken of, whilst the _Lady_ does the same to the right.

There are, besides, other Ways of performing this Step from 
the said third Position, as sideways crossing to the right Hand, and 
in a Hop, Step, and Draw behind sideways to the left; which 
Steps differ from the foregoing in this, that whereas they were 
made either forwards or backwards, facing to the upper Part of the 
Room, or the same turning to the Sides or lower End of it, these, 
on the contrary, are always sideways, tho' they are performed turn[-]
ing all the Ways aforesaid: For Instance, to the right Hand side[-]
ways, the Face or Presence being to the upper End of the Room, 
and the Weight in the Position already explained[[See the second Figure of Plate V]], the _Hop_ 
is performed in like Manner excepting that, instead of the left Foot's 
advancing as in that, or retiring from the _Hop_ or _Spring_ which 
is made on the right, it is here cast crossways before the right 
upon which the Body rests, about the Length of a _March_, and 
then receives the Weight[[See the second Figure of Plate XI]]; after which the right Foot makes the 
second Step of the _Contretemp_ open off sideways, in the Manner 
above described in _forwards_[[See in some Degree the second Figure in Plate VI]].

When it is performed turning with a quarter Turn, or a half 
Turn, _&c_. it only varies in its not advancing to the Sides or low[-]
er End of the Room, as in the other, but, instead of that, it is 
made sideways to the right Hand, facing to the right Side of 
the Room in a quarter Turn, in the same Manner as to the upper 
End; the half Turn the like, only not facing to the right Side of 
Room, but instead thereof to the lower Part of it, which is a 
quarter of a Turn more.

The second of the Ways aforesaid is the Hop, Step, and Draw 
behind sideways, which is as follows, _viz_. to the right or left Hand, 
{61} the last of which begins from the same Position treated of in this 
Step, namely, the third, the disengaged Foot being upon the 
Point behind the right[[See the second Figure in Plate V]], from whence this Step commences by 
making a Sink and upright Spring or Hop, falling in the same Place 
and Posture, as at first, only the Knees are bent; after which the 
left Foot upon the Point steps open off sideways to the same Hand, 
and receives the Weight of the Body from the right, either placing 
the Heel to the Ground or upon the Toe[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]]; and the right Foot, 
being then released, after the Hop and Step are made, as aforesaid, is 
drawn behind the left, the Toe pressing the Floor[[See the second Figure in Plate VI]]; as it is brought 
behind, and receives the Weight of the Body, as at commencing 
in the third Position, except that, instead of the left Foot's being 
pointed behind, it is now inclos'd before and concludes[[See the first Figure in Plate IV, or second of Plate XI]].

This Step with a quarter Turn differs from the _Hop_ crossways 
to the right, only in the latter's not being made to the same Hand; 
for the quarter Turn, instead thereof, is performed, as above de[-]
scribed, stepping to the left Hand, facing full to the right Side of 
Room, as in the other, and the half Turn, facing the lower Part 
of the Room, is, in its Performance to the left Hand, the same as 
the quarter to the right.

Having explained the foregoing _Hop_'s Beginning with the left 
Foot from the third Position, I shall now describe it sideways with 
the same Foot, from what I call the _fourth Position_; that is to say, 
the Weight of the Body is upon the right, the left being directly 
the same sideways as the Beginning or first Movement in a _March_, 
only the Toe is not pointed to the Ground, as in that, but the Heel 
placed without any Weight[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]]; from which Posture of Standing 
this Step is taken and performed: For Instance, the Weight being 
upon the right Foot, and the left Heel placed, as aforesaid, about 
the Length of a Step in _Walking_, you make the Sink or Prepara[-]
tion for the _Spring_ or _Hop_[[See the first Figure in Plate X]] by transferring the Weight from the 
{62} right to the left Foot, the very Moment before the _Spring_ is 
made, in taking up the right Foot from the Ground, the left at 
the same Instant receiving the Body, upon which the Hop is be[-]
gun and compleated, as follows: The right Foot, being then 
at Liberty[[See the second Figure in Plates VI and XV]], makes a plain Step or Walk sideways crossing before 
the left, that supports the Weight, to the same Hand[[See the first Figure in Plate XI]]; after 
which the left Foot steps out the same Way and places the Heel, 
being ready to make the _Spring_, as before[[See the first Figure in Plate X]], by Reason you are 
now in the same Position, as at commencing, and concludes the 
Step.

This _Hop_, as just described, is to be found in the second Strain 
of the _Rigadoon_ of the late Mr. _Isaac_, the first Time of playing over, 
at the End of the third _Bouree_ of the _Woman's_ Side; where the _La[-]
dy_ stands upon the second Step of the said _Bouree_, _viz._ the right 
Foot, whilst the left, instead of receiving the Body as it would other[-]
wise have done, only sets down the Heel to the Ground. From 
this Posture proceeds the _Hop_ or _Contretemp_ we are now treating 
of, which takes up the fourth Bar or Measure; and, as I have re[-]
ferred to this Place for an Example, I think it will not be improper 
to say something here of the _Hop_ that follows the foregoing: Which 
differs in this, that whereas in the former the Heel is to be placed 
to the Ground upon the last Step, in this a _Bound_ is made instead 
thereof, which is the only Difference, and the Reason of its being 
called a _Hop_, _Step_, and _Bound_; and it also remarkably varies from 
the aforesaid, in that it again conducts the _Dancer_ into the _Bou[-]
rees_, _Coupees_, and _Half Coupees_, _&c_. as the other leads him out of 
these Steps. To perform this _Contretemp_ or _Hop_ from the _fourth 
Position forwards_, the left or beginning Foot instead of being open 
sideways, as before, must be advanced, about the like Distance be[-]
fore the right, as the other was upon one Side of it; which Man[-]
ner of Standing is what we call the _fourth Position_, from whence 
the _Hop_ is to be made, being, in all Respects, the same as _sideways_ 
{63} _to the left Hand_ only, as I have said, the left Foot must be advan[-]
ced up the Room, which is done as follows: The Weight of the 
Body being upon the right Foot, and the Heel of the left to the 
Ground, as aforesaid[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], the _Contretemp_ is made forwards upon 
the left Foot, the right being taken up from the Floor; which 
said right Foot then makes a plain Walk or Step forwards[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]], that 
in the foregoing was made sideways crossing before the left; after 
which the left Foot is advanced, the Length of a Step, and the 
Heel placed in the fourth Position, as at commencing this Step, in 
Readiness to repeat the same[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]. But, instead of that, I shall pro[-]
ceed to shew, how this Step is performed from the said Position 
_backwards_, _viz._ by the Weight's not advancing _forwards_ to the left 
Foot, as before, but on the contrary the _Hop_ is made on the right 
Foot _backwards_ by taking up the left Foot, in like Manner as the 
other _forwards_ in taking up of the right, except that the Weight is 
not transferred, as in the former, and then it makes the Step or 
or[[опечатка: лишнее or]] Walk _backwards_ the same as before _forwards_[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]]; after which the 
right Foot makes the second and last Step _backwards_ also and re[-]
ceives the Body, leaving the left Heel to the Floor, as at first, ei[-]
ther to advance or retire[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]; and these are the most usual Ways of 
performing this Step from the fourth Position.

The Method of performing the _Hop_ or _Contretemp_, both from 
the third and fourth Position, being now explained, I shall take 
some Notice, how they agree with the Notes of Music, either of 
common or triple Time, _&c_. as for Example, from the third Posi[-]
tion _forwards_, beginning with the left or advancing Foot to a Tune 
of common Time; which being accomplished will shew the Man[-]
ner of the rest, whether _backwards_, _sideways_, or _round_, in that the 
same Method of counting will bear in them all, since the _Hop_ 
certainly marks the first Note or what we call _Time_, tho' it be 
upon the right Foot, as in the third Position, or on the left in the 
{64} fourth as follows, _viz_. the _Spring_ or _Hop_, that is made upon the right 
Foot, beats Time to the first of the four Notes; the second Note is count[-]
ed in the setting down or receiving the Weight of the Body upon 
the eft[[пропущена буква, должно быть: left]] Foot, after its having advanced the Length of a Step for[-]
wards; and the third Note is counted, when the right Foot re[-]
ceives the Body, as before, and finishes. The remaining fourth 
Note, as has been said, is in the Sink which prepares for the suc[-]
ceeding Step; and, to triple Time or of the Notes in three Bar or 
Measure, it is the very same, except that, as there are only three 
Notes, half the third must be borrowed for the Sink that prepares 
to mark the Cadence of the succeeding Step.

### CHAP. XXI.

### _Of the CHASSE or DRIVING STEP._

THE _Hop_ or _Contretemp_ last explained having introduced us to 
the Position from whence the _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ is per[-]
formed, namely, the _fourth_, since in that we took no farther No[-]
tice than of its being _sideways_, or _forwards_, in the said Position, 
without explaining the particular Manner in which the last Step, 
whether of a _Bouree_, _Coupee_, _Half Coupee_, or _March_ is to be per[-]
formed, when introducing any of the aforesaid _Hops_ or _Driving 
Steps_; and as this Step considerably varies, in its Method of Per[-]
formance, from the Way in which it would otherwise have been done, 
had a _Bouree_, or _Coupee, &c._ followed, I shall observe, that it is 
much the same as when, in _Fencing_, we put ourselves in a Posture 
of Defence; but, this Posture being probably unknown to the _La[-]
dies_, I shall endeavour to give an Explanation of it, which take as 
follows: The Posture of Defence most usually is to the right Hand, 
the whole Weight of the Body being upon the left Foot, and the 
right stepped out sideways to the same Side of the Room, about 
{65} the Length of a Step, as in _Walking_; the full Part of the Heel 
first comes to the Ground, but afterwards the Foot is flat, only 
free from Weight, both the Knees being bent[[See the second Figure in Plate X]]; from which 
Position or Posture the _Hop_ before treated of is taken, as well as 
the _Chassee_ we are now about to describe, or from whence the 
_Longe_ or _Pass_ is made in _Fencing_.

However it still remains to shew the Method, how the above[-]
mentioned Step is to be performed, when we put ourselves in the said 
Position or Posture, in which consists the Perfection of it; and, 
for the greater Variety, in describing the same we shall begin to 
the right Hand, having already observed it to the left, in the 
_Hop_ aforesaid. But, for the better understanding of this, we must 
take Notice, that in a _Bouree_ we are to make a Stop or Rest upon 
the second Step, when any of this Sort of Steps follow; in the 
_Coupee_ upon the first, and in a _Half Coupee_ or _March_, _&c_. we 
stand in one of the Positions from whence it is to be taken, which 
differ according to the foregoing Step's being performed forwards, 
backwards, or sideways; but, in all of them, it is generally taken 
from the first or third Position either before or behind[[See the first Figure in Plate I. second Figure in Plate IV. or first Figure in Plate V]]. We shall 
begin with the last: For Example, the Weight of the Body being 
upon the left Foot, the right at Liberty behind it prepares for the 
_Kick_ or soft _Stamp_ sideways, for so I must name it, as not knowing 
what more properly to call it, by raising the Heel of the hindmost 
Foot, whether right or left, with a gentle and easy Motion, the 
Toe or Ball of the Instep pointing down to the Ground, but not so 
as to bear upon it, by Reason it will not be ready to perform the 
Step aforesaid; which is exceeding swift, because, as I have said, 
the _Dancer_ makes a Pause or Rest, until the fourth Note in com[-]
mon Time is almost spent, and in triple the third; but, _before ei[-]
ther of them_ expire, the easy _Stamp_ or _Kick_ is given, and instead of 
the Foot's being flat to the Ground, as in _Fencing_, in _Dancing_ the 
Heel must first be placed thereto in order to receive the _Chassee_ 
{66} or _Hop_ that succeeds[[See the second Figure in Plate X]]. How the latter of them is to be exe[-]
cuted, we have shewn in the _Hops_; and, having just before obser[-]
ved the raising of the Heel and pointing of the Toe, I shall also 
take Notice, that, just as the _Kick_ or _Stamp_ is about to be made, 
the Toe, instead of pointing to the Floor, as at commencing, rises 
from thence; and the Heel comes down, but does not receive the 
Weight, 'till the _Hop_ or _Chassee_ is made, which, in _Dancing_, is 
always immediately after this Step, it being a Preparation to that 
Purpose; for, as I have said, the Knees being bent, at the Instant 
the right Heel is struck against the Floor, it only remains to per[-]
form the Steps treated on; and whether _forwards_, or _backwards_, 
the Method is the same, as _sideways_ above explained to the right 
Hand.

Having now given some Hints, as to the Manner how the Step, 
that introduces a _Hop_ or _Chassee_, is to be performed, I shall proceed 
to the Explanation of the latter, which is a Step composed sometimes 
of three, and at other Times of four Steps to the Measure or Bar; 
and the most usual Way of their Performance is _forwards_ and _side[-]
ways_. I shall begin with the former of these, namely, the _Chassee_ 
or _Driving-Step_ of three Steps in a Measure, advancing to the upper 
Part of the Room, which is as follows, _viz_. the Weight of the 
Body being upon the left Foot, and the right stepped forwards, as 
just explained, into the fourth Position[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]] with the Knees bent, in 
order to the Performance of the _Chassee_, it begins by transfer[-]
ring the Weight; that is to say, before the rising from the said Sink, 
the Body, that was on the left Foot, is conveyed upon the right 
and foremost Foot, which then supports it, whilst the left, disen[-]
gaged from the Weight, advances the Length of a Step, in rising 
from the abovesaid Sink into the third Position inclosed behind the 
right, and again receives the Body. The said Rising beats Time to 
the first Note of the Measure[[See the second Figure in Plate IV. or first of Plate XI]], upon which the right, being at 
{67} Liberty, makes the second of the three Steps[[See the second Figure in Plate IX. only the right or advanced Foot is more open]]; but it differs 
somewhat from that of the _Bouree_, in its being stepped more open 
off to the right Hand, whereas the _Bouree_ is directly advancing 
forwards upon which is counted the second Note; and the last is 
reckoned in the _Kick_ or light _Stamp_ that prepares for the _Chassee_ 
following, which is the last of the three Steps, and made with the 
left Foot; for, as I have said, the Body, being on the right, rests 
thereon, whilst the left moves slowly forwards, the Toe pressing to 
the Floor, as in the _March_; but not much above half its Length, 
in that the remaining Part is allowed to the light _Stamp_ the left 
Foot gives forwards, on the Expiration of the last Note; upon 
which it is then in readiness to perform the same thing over again, 
as in the _Bouree_[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]; for this Step, in Continuance, changes the 
Foot, every three Steps, the same as a _Bouree_. This Step with 
the contrary Foot differs only in the Weight's being upon the 
right Foot, instead of the left, as in the former; and the left, at 
the End of the second Step of the foregoing _Chassee_, being advan[-]
ced into the fourth Position, in the Manner we have just observed, 
begins by transferring the Weight, and taking up the right Foot, 
as the other did by the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IV. or second of Plate XI. For the second Step only more open, as has been said, see the first the Figure in Place IX. and for the last Step, see the second Figure in the same Plate]], and so on if continued.

This Step _sideways_ is the same as above explain'd, except that, 
instead of forwards, it is made sideways, which is the principal 
Difference; however, for the more easy comprehending of the same, 
I shall observe, that it begins from the fourth Position sideways to 
the right Side of the Room, the Face or Presence of the Body be[-]
ing to the upper End of the Room, the Weight upon the left Foot as 
before, with the right placed, as described by the Posture of Defence, 
or Step which introduces this Sort of Steps[[See the second Figure in Plate X]]. The Weight is trans[-]
ferred, as before; and, in rising, the left Foot is taken from the 
Ground, but, instead of advancing up the Room, is now brought 
{68} sideways into the third Position inclosed behind the right, and re[-]
ceives the Weight in Time to the Music[[See the second Figure in Plate IV. or first Figure in Plate XI]]. The second Step, 
with the right Foot, is sideways, the same Way, and receives the 
Body[[first upon the Toe and afterwards upon the Heel. See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate VI. and second Figure in Plate X]], which it supports, 'till the third or fourth Note is expir[-]
ed[[See the Point or first Figure in Plate VI]], according to the Time in which it is done, that is, whe[-]
ther it be of triple or common; upon which the last Step or _light 
Stamp_ is made, the same Way crossing before the right[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], with 
the Knees bent in readiness to proceed to the _Chassee_ following, 
which is performed in like Manner, but on the contrary Foot.

As we are now come to the _Chassee_ of four Steps in a Measure, 
the foregoing of three having been described commencing with 
the left Foot, both _forwards sideways_ and _to the right Hand_, I 
shall, on the contrary, explain this beginning with the right Foot, 
_to the left Hand_; but, in the first Place, I shall describe it, _advan[-]
cing_ up the Room, which is as follows: The Weight being upon 
the right Foot, the left advanced into the fourth Position[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], in 
the Method already explain'd, begins, as before, by transferring the 
Weight, but, as I have said, with the other Foot; for, as the _Chas[-]
see_ of three in the Bar transferred the Weight from the left to the 
right, this does it from the right to the left, the right and hindmost 
Foot advancing into the third Position inclosed behind the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IV. or second of Plate XI. and, for the second Step which is made quick at the same Time, see the first Figure in Plate IX]], 
directly the same Way as in that of three, except with this Diffe[-]
rence, that as the first Note in that was counted in the rising and 
bringing of the Foot into the third Position, in this the two first 
Steps of the four must be performed swift to the first Note, as has 
been noted in the _Bouree_ and _Bound_; and the second Note is in 
the stepping forwards of the third Step[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]], only, as I have observed, 
a little open; upon which the Weight rests, 'till the third Note 
{69} in triple Time is spent, or in common the fourth, in like Manner 
as, in the _Driving-Step_ of three, it rested on the second, waiting 
for the Expiration of the third or fourth last Notes, at which In[-]
stant the Step or Preparative for the next ensuing is made, and con[-]
cludes[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]].

In performing the _Chassee_ of four Steps in a Measure, above ex[-]
plained _forwards, to the left Hand sideways_, the left Foot, instead 
of being advanced, is open sideways in the fourth Position, the 
like Distance to the left Hand, as in the _Point_ or Beginning of a 
_March_, only the Heel and Foot are flat, as has been shewn, in the 
_Hop_ or _Contretemp_, to this Side of the Room[[See the first Figure in Plate X]] and it commences 
by changing, as above, forwards, only the right Foot, instead of 
advancing as in that, moves sideways and is brought, in the rising 
behind the left, into the third Position[[See the first Figure in Plate IV. or second Figure of Plate XI]], at which Instant the 
left Foot, which is the second of the four Steps, is stepp'd with a 
swift Motion, the same Way, and marks Time to the first Note[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate VI]]. 
Note The second is in the stepping and crossing of the right Foot 
before the left[[See the second Figure in the same Plate, and first Figure in Plate XI]], which is the third Step; and the third is in the 
setting of the left Heel down, in order to perform it again, as was 
illustrated by the Posture in _Fencing_, or in common Time upon 
the fourth as has been said[[See the first Figure in Plate X]].

This Step may also be performed with a quarter Turn, which 
only differs in this, that, after the Rise or Movement is made to 
the first two Steps that mark Time to the first Note, the third Step, 
which is with the right Foot, instead of crossing before the left, as 
before, in the stepping of it, turns a quarter Turn, which then 
faces full to the left Side of the Room to the Music as above; the 
fourth and last Step, which is with the left Foot, steps sideways to 
the left Hand, the same Way as the foregoing to the Presence, and, 
if continued one Step farther, the first two Steps face to the left Side 
{70} of the Room, as the foregoing did to the upper Part; and the 
third Step, in which you turn the quarter, instead of stepping to 
the left Side of the Room, now faces to the lower End of it; the 
fourth Step, with the left Foot, steps sideways to the same Hand, 
and so on, if you please, 'till arrived to the Presence as at first. It 
is to be noted, that this Step does not, in Continuance, change the 
Foot, as the _Chassee_ of three in the Measure, or _Bouree_, but al[-]
ways begins with the same Foot, as in the _Bouree with a Bound_.

There is another Way of performing this Step, of which I shall 
take some Notice, _viz_. two Movements and Steps to the Measure, 
that is to say, the _Chassee_ of three Steps in a Bar already explain'd, 
to which is added a Sort of a _Half Coupee_, in the Nature of a _Dri[-]
ving-Step_; which said Step is the fourth of the last described _Chas[-]
see_, except that it is made plain here with a Movement or Rise from 
the fourth Position from whence it begun, and the released Foot 
opens in the Air, forming a quarter of a Circle, or a half Cir[-]
cle, _&c_.

As to the Performance of this _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ of two 
Movements, the most usual Way is forwards, turning a quarter, 
half, three quarter, or a whole Turn, the first of which is as follows, 
_viz_. beginning, as we will suppose, with the right Foot, upon 
which the Weight stands in the fourth Position, and the left ad[-]
vanced, but without any Weight[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], as has been said, except its 
own, commences by transferring the Weight in the same Man[-]
ner as described in the _Chassee_ of four Steps with one Movement 
forwards to the upper Part of the Room, that is, the first two Steps, 
namely, with the right Foot and the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IV. For the second Step which is made quick at the same Time, see the first in Plate IX]]; but not the third Step 
with the right, for, altho' it steps a little open, as in the aforesaid, 
it does not receive any Weight, by reason it prepares for the _Half 
Coupee_, which is to be made in the Manner of the _Chassee_ before 
mentioned. This Step is made upon the second Note of the three, 
as was explained by the Posture in _Fencing_, only instead of _sideways_ 
{71} it is forwards[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]]; and, as was already shewn, the Knees being bent 
and Weight upon the left Foot, the _Half Coupee_, the second Move[-]
ment of the _Chassee_, begins by conveying or transferring the Bo[-]
dy from the left to the right and foremost Foot, immediately before 
rising, on which the left or hindmost Foot advances, sliding the 
Ball or Instep flat to the Ground into the third Position behind the 
right[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]], which it releases; and, in its being taken up from the 
Floor, it makes a quarter of a Circle in the Air, opening to the 
right Side[[See the second Figure in Plates XIV and XV]], facing the upper Part of the Room, or a quarter 
Turn to the right Side; or a half Turn to the Bottom, a three 
quarter Turn to the left Side, or a whole Turn; which said 
_Coupee_ is performed to the third Note, if to triple Time; and in 
common to the fourth.

### CHAP. XXII.

### _Of the CHASSEE, or DRIVING STEP 
    of two Movements or Bounding COUPEES._

THIS Step is performed two different Ways, _viz. advancing_ and 
_retiring_; the former of which begins by transferring the Weight 
resting on the right or left Leg in the fourth Position, and the lat[-]
ter by a Sway or Wave of the Poise of the Body, either on the 
right or left Leg from the second Position, which is the most usual 
Method of performing this Step; for, being in the second Position, 
and the Weight as much on one Foot as the other, it is only wa[-]
ving or swaying the Body, whether upon the right or left Foot, 
during the Sink, preparing for the _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_, that is 
made by the disengaged and pointed Foot, whichsoever it be, al[-]
ways {72} _retiring_ to the right or left, or backwards. But, if it begin from 
the Weight resting on the right or left Foot, as _advancing_ to make 
the _Contretemp_, _Chassees_, or the like, it begins by changing, other[-]
wise directly, without changing, being duly prepared; tho' in its 
Performance _advancing_, it much resembles the _Chassee_ to the left 
Hand, of one Movement to four Steps, except that, instead of one Move[-]
ment made upon the Ground, here are two Movements or _Coupees_ off 
from thence; and it is a Step frequently found in Tunes of com[-]
mon Time, not much unlike what we often see _Boys_ perform in 
Play, when they run along, and, in rising from a Sink, knock or 
beat one Heel against the other, lighting in the fourth Position, 
with the Knees bent, continuing the same, perhaps, the Length 
of a Stret[[опечатка]] or Field.

The _Driving Step_ or _Chassee_ of two Movements or _Bounding 
Coupees_ is usually perform'd sideways, tho' sometimes to one Part 
of the Room, and sometimes to another, as it falls out, which is 
according as the foregoing Step ended _to the right or left Sides, 
or upper or lower Ends_ of the Room; for the better understanding 
whereof I shall give an Example of it to the left Hand, facing up 
the Room as follows, _viz._ the Weight of the Body being upon the 
right Foot, the left in the fourth Position sideways, as in the forego[-]
ing _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ of four Steps, to the same Side of the 
Room, the Knees bent[[See the first Figure in Plate X]], _&c._ it begins by transferring the 
Weight to the left Foot, as in that, only in the rising, instead of 
the right Foot's being brought behind the left in the third Position 
as in that upon the Ground, it is here made off from thence, in 
a sort of Springing or Bounding sideways, in which the right and 
commencing Foot, in a Manner, _drives_ the left and second Step 
of the _Coupee_ before it; for the Spring or Bound no sooner is given 
and the right Foot brought into the first Position even, or the third 
Position behind the left[[See the second Figure in Plate I. or first Figure in Plate IV]], than the left being at Liberty is _driven_ 
the Length of a Step sideways[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate VI]] and then set down in the fourth 
{73} Position, the Knees being bent, as in the Posture of _Defence_. 
This second Step concludes the first of the two Movements or _Cou[-]
pees_[[See the first Figure in Plate X]], the Bound or Beginning of which is made upon the first 
of the four Notes, in that they are both counted as no more than 
one Step, as has been already shewn, not only in the _Bouree_ and 
_Bound_ but also in the _Chassee_ of four Steps; the second of the four 
Notes is reckoned in the Rest or Pause the Weight makes upon 
the Sink that prepares for the second Movement, _viz_. the third and 
fourth Steps, perform'd in the same Method as the first, by trans[-]
ferring the Weight, as aforesaid, and being made upon the third 
Note concludes the Step; and the fourth, as I have said, is in 
the Sink or Preparation for the succeeding Step, whether it be of 
the same, or any other Sort.

To perform this Step _to the right Hand_ is only to transfer the 
Weight: For Example, instead of the Body's resting upon the right 
Foot, as before, it must be placed on the left, with the right dis[-]
engaged from any Weight, except its own, as has been shewn by 
the foregoing[[See the second Figure in Plate X]]; the rest intirely, in the like Manner, advancing 
sideways to the right Side of the Room, as the other to the left.

Having explained this Step _advancing_, I will proceed to its Me[-]
thod of _retiring_; and the Difference between this and the former 
principally consists in the Weight of the Body's not being changed 
on its beginning now, as in the foregoing; but instead thereof it 
directly commences from the fourth Position in which we stand: 
For Instance, suppose you would perform it _retiring_, the same Way 
we have described it _advancing, viz_. sideways to the left, then, 
instead of the Body's resting upon the right Foot, as in the afore[-]
said, it must now rest on the left, the right being in the fourth 
Position sideways flat to the Ground, without any other Weight 
than its own, except the Toe a little pointed or pressing to the 
Floor, from whence it begins.

However, before I proceed in that, I shall explain it _retiring_ 
down the Room; which is from the same Position, only the right 
{74} Foot is advanced, and not sideways, as here; and because a _Bea[-]
ten Coupee_ or _Hop_, either forwards or sideways, generally introdu[-]
ces this Step, it may likewise not be improper to take some Notice 
of it, which I shall do, in the Explanation of the said Step's _advan[-]
cing_ up the Room, since that will be sufficient for the compre[-]
hending of it both Ways, in that the same Manner of Performance 
is to be observed in the one as in the other, only in the former the 
_Beat_ is made sideways, instead of backwards, as in the pre[-]
sent.

### CHAP. XXIII.

### _Of the BEATEN COUPEE or HOP._

THE _Beaten Coupee_ or _Hop_ forwards, beginning from the first 
Position, the Weight of the Body being upon the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate I]], 
makes a Movement or Sink and Rise, as was shewn in the _Half 
Coupee_ up the Room[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate IX]] and receives the Weight, as in that, upon 
the first Note, supporting the Body, whilst the left Foot _strikes_ or 
_beats_ against the Heel of the right[[See the second Figure in Plate V]], which _Beat_ is upon the se[-]
cond Note; and then it steps back to the Place from whence it 
came, in order to receive the Weight again, which after the _Beat_ 
retires off from the Foot upon which it was, in a slow Motion, 
waiting for the Expiration of the third Note; upon which it comes 
down on the left Foot, in the fourth Position, much in the swift 
Manner described in the Preparation for a _Hop_ or _Chassee_[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]].

If you would perform this Step with a _Hop_ you only need, in[-]
stead of the Movement as above, make a _Spring_ or _Hop_ upon the 
left Foot, whilst the right advances, as was explained in the first 
Spring of the _Rigadoon Step_ of two; but tho' the Weight there does 
{75} not come upon the advancing Foot, by Reason a second Spring is 
to be given first, here it must, as in the ending of a _March_, after 
which receiving of the Body the _Beat_ is given, as above.

Having explained the _Beaten Coupee_ or _Hop_, which conducts us 
to the Step we are treating of, and being in the Position from whence 
it is taken, that is to say, in the fourth, with the Weight upon the 
left Foot, and the right advanced, or more properly speaking, 
where it was left, in finishing of the _Beaten Hop_ or _Coupee_; being 
I say in the fourth Position, with the Knees bent, the _Flying Chas[-]
see_ or _Driving Step_ of two Movements commences backwards, by 
bringing the right and foremost pointed Foot, in the Nature of a 
Spring or low Bound in rising from the Sink or Bending aforesaid 
into the third Position inclos'd before the left[[See the second Figure of Plate IV]]; which Bound or 
coming down of the right Foot marks Time to the first Note and 
relieves the left, which it drives backwards, the Length of a Step, 
receiving the Weight in the fourth Position[[See the second Figure of Plate IX]], with the Knees bent 
as at commencing, upon which the first Movement is ended. The 
Bound and Step are both reckoned, on account of their Swiftness, 
but as one; and the second Movement is made to the third and 
fourth Steps, which are, in their Performance, intirely the same as 
the first. The second Note is in the Bending of the Knees, after 
finishing of the first Spring or _Coupee_; the third in the Bound upon 
the right Foot, which begins the second Movement; and the 
fourth is in the Bending of the Knees, as aforesaid.

As the Method, in which this Step is perform'd _retiring_, is now 
shewn, I shall return to the Place where I left off, and proceed in 
explaining it, as retiring sideways to the left Side of the Room and 
conclude what I shall farther say, on that Head; and first of all 
it must be noted, that it is the Reverse to the foregoing _advancing_, 
for as in that the Foot, on which the Body rests at beginning, _pur[-]
sues_ or _drives_ before it the Foot without Weight, in this the disen[-]
gaged Foot _drives_ or _pursues_ the _retiring_ Foot that supports the 
Body, much like _retiring_ in _Fencing_, as the first explain'd is a Sort 
{76} of _advancing_, which I think plainly appears from what has been 
said inthe[[пропущен пробел: in the]] Description of them.

The latter of the said Steps being now fully described, it only 
remains to add that, instead of backwards, it must be made _reti[-]
ring_ directly sideways, crossing the Room to the left Hand, in the 
same Manner as _retiring_ down it, which is all the Difference; 
and consequently it is unnecessary to make a farther Repetition, 
except that, as where I left off[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate VI]], it commences from the fourth 
Position; and if perform'd _retiring_ cross the Room to the right Side, 
it is taken from the same Position as when _advancing_ to the left, on[-]
ly as I have observed, it begins without transferring the Weight; 
but, when taken from the second Position, it is only swaying or 
waving the Body to the Side you would perform it, whether right 
or left.

It is to be noted, that the foregoing _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ of 
two springing Movements, when perform'd in triple Time, must 
have a _Springing Coupee_ more added, to fill up the Bar or Measure; 
or instead thereof a _Close_, which is nothing more than that instead of 
finishing the additional _Coupee_, or in the Bound's lighting upon one 
Foot, as in that I described, it comes down upon both Feet, at 
the same Time, to the third Note in triple Time, compleating the 
Measure, as if the _Coupee_ had been finished. Examples of the lat[-]
ter are to be found in the _Chaconne de Phaeton_ of Monsieur _Pecour_, 
twenty Bars before the End; and the foregoing of two _Springs_ and 
a _Close_ is to be met with in the _Passacaille de Scilla_ by the same 
Master, twenty seven Measures before the End, and in Tunes of 
common Time, as _Allemaignes_, _Rigadoons_, _Bourees_, _&c_. but, in[-]
stead of the _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ of two _Springs_, we frequent[-]
ly meet with one of them put with the aforesaid _Close_ to a Mea[-]
sure[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables mark'd I]].

### {77} CHAP. XXIV. 

### _Of the CHASSEE or DRIVING STEP, 
    of three Springs in the Same Place, from the 
    third Position._

THIS _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_ differs from the aforesaid, in its 
not being taken from the fourth Position, but from the third, 
in which Position as an Example we shall describe it, beginning 
with the right Foot, as follows, _viz_. the Weight is upon the left 
Foot, and the right in the third Position behind, being at Liber[-]
ty[[See the first Figure in Plate V]], commences by bending both Knees, and at the same Time 
preparing for the _Close_ or _Drive_, which is accomplished in the 
Straightening of the right Knee directly sideways[[See the second Figure in Plate XV, or second Figure in Plate VI, only the Toe does not touch the Floor]], in the Rise 
or Spring from the Sinking aforesaid; in which it is brought into 
the third Position before the left on which the Body rests[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]], and 
_drives_ the left off sideways, or rather obliquely, in the Air[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, only the Foot is in the Air]], the Length of a Step. The said _Spring_ or _Drive_ with the right Foot marks 
Time to the first Note of the three in a Measure or triple Time; 
and the second is in the _Spring_ or _Drive_ with the left Foot now in 
the Air, which together with the right Knee that supports the 
Body bends, in order for the second Spring, which is made in a Rise 
from the same by a Spring or Bound into the third Position behind; 
then it releases the right by receiving the Weight[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]] and _drives_ 
the right Foot sideways into the Air, the Length of a Step[[See the second Figure in Plate XV]], 
from whence the third _Drive_ or _Close_ is made to the same Note, 
{78} by bending both Knees, as before; and, in the Spring or Rising 
from thence, the right Foot in the Air _bounds_ into the third Posi[-]
tion before the left[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]] which it releases, tho' it is not _driven_, as 
in the others, but instead thereof remains in the third Position be[-]
hind the right on which the whole Weight rests, concluding the 
Step on the contrary Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate V]], in Readiness to perform the same 
Step over again, and commencing with the left Foot.

The second Strain of the _Louvre_ begins with this Step, the last 
Time of its playing over, with the same Foot as here, that is to 
say, on the _Man's_ Side, but with the contrary on the _Woman's_; 
and in the _Dance_ it is performed facing to the right Side of the 
Room or _Lady_, and not to the upper End of it, as here described. 

In triple Time this Step transfers the Weight and Foot, every 
Measure as in the _Half Coupee_, _March_, or _Bouree_; but, when 
done to Tunes of common Time, instead of three _Drives_ or _Springs_ 
in a Measure, as in triple aforesaid, there must be only two; and 
consequently, if continued, they will always commence with the 
same Foot as the _Bouree_ and a _Bound_, or _Coupee_, _&c_. unless Steps 
of a contrary Nature, as the _Bouree, Half Coupee_, or _March_ be 
made between them.

The _Driving Step_ of two Springs agrees with the Notes of 
common Time, in the same Manner as was described in the _Flying_ 
or _Driving Step_ of two Movements; and it makes no small Figure, 
either in common or triple Time, since in the latter it is rare to meet 
with a _Passacaille_, or _Chaconne_, without it; but, on the contrary 
it is sometimes found in three or four Places of one _Dance_, which 
demonstrates, how greatly it is valued and esteemed by _Masters_[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables mark'd I]].

### {79} CHAP. XXV. 

### _Of the FLYING CHASSEE or DRIVING 
    STEP backwards, with a CLOSE and 
    COUPEE to a Measure_

THE Step, which I am now about to explain, begins from the 
fourth Position, as well as the _Hop_ or _Chassee_; but, before I 
proceed, it must be observed, that it is composed of three different 
Steps, and commences with the first Movement of the _Flying Chas[-]
see_ or _Driving Step_ retiring down the Room exactly in the same 
Manner as was explained, in treating of that Step[[See Page 75]], ending in the 
fourth Position to the first Note, the Weight being upon the left 
Foot, and the right advanced, or rather, as I have said, left with[-]
out Weight, in Readiness to begin the second Movement of the 
said Step[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]]; which Movement is made upon the second Note of 
the _Saraband_ or _Passacaille_, to which it is done by making a 
_Close_ from the Position above mentioned, in rising from the Sink or 
Bending of the Knees in which the _Chassee_ to the first Note end[-]
ed; which _Spring_ or _Close_ is made, in turning a quarter Turn to 
the right Side of the Room, from the upper Part thereof, into the 
third Position, by taking up the right or advanced Foot, at the 
Instant the _Close_ is made upon the left, before which the right is 
inclosed[[See the second Figure in Plate IV, only it must be supposed facing to the right Side of the Room]]. The third Note is in the _Coupee_, which is the third 
Movement and concludes the Step; and the said _Coupee_, which 
must be performed swift to the last Note, commences, by the right 
{80} or inclosed Foot's making a Movement or Sink and Rise, stepping 
open off sideways to the right Hand[[See in some Respects the second Figure in Plate VI, only it must be supposed to the right Side of the Room]], facing, as aforesaid, to the 
right Side of the Room, rather inclining backwards than directly 
sideways, by Reason of its making Way for the left or hind Foot's 
more easy and natural crossing before the right sideways into the 
fifth Position, in the Method shewn in treating of the _Slip before 
and then behind_, ending, as I have said, upon the third Note, 
with the Knees bent preparing for the following Step, which most 
usually is a _Half Coupee_[[See the second Figure in Plate XI. and it also must be facing as aforesaid]]; and it begins by taking of the right 
or hind Foot up, in rising from the aforesaid Bending of the Knees, 
which is brought behind the left into the third Position[[See the first Figure in Plate IV]], turn[-]
ing a quarter Turn back again, from the right Side of the Room 
to the upper End, upon the first Note of the Measure. The se[-]
cond and third Notes are in the half Circle or Motion the left Foot 
makes in the Air, in its being taken from the Floor,[[See the first Figure in Plate XV]] which, as 
I have said, is upon the right Foot's receiving the Weight in the 
Rise from the first Step; and the left Foot, being in the Air, is 
ready to perform a _Pirouette_, or any such like Step.

If, instead of the right Side of the Room, you would perform it 
to the other Hand, the left Foot must be in the fourth Position ad[-]
vanced before the right on which the Body rests, in like Man[-]
ner as the right was before, without any Weight except its own[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], 
from whence it commences to the left Side of the Room, directly 
as the foregoing to the right; and the Step here treated on is to be 
found in the _Passacaille Darmid_ for a _Woman_, composed by 
Monsieur _L'Abbee_, in the sixth Measure, beginning with the right 
Foot, as above explained[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked I]].

### {81} CHAP. XXVI.

### _Of the HOP of two Movements, from the fifth 
    Position round in two half Turns._

THIS Step is much used in _Stage Dancing_, to which, indeed it 
properly belongs, as well as the foregoing; but as there are 
_Ladies_, who frequently arrive at such a Perfection as to be capable of 
performing this Sort of Steps, it may not be improper here to give an 
Explanation of some of the most remarkable of them, of which 
Number that under Consideration is one; which is often found in 
Tunes of triple Time, and sometimes in those of common, consist[-]
ing of two Movements, _viz_. a _Hop_ and a _Bound_ both made in 
turning, the first commencing either from the fourth or fifth Posi[-]
tion; from which last we shall explain it, beginning with the right 
Foot that supports the Body, as in the _Chassee_ or _Driving Step_, 
only the left, instead of being either open sideways or advanced in 
the fourth Position, from whence the aforesaid Steps are taken, must 
be a little more crossed, that is to say, the left Heel towards the Toe 
of the right Foot, without the least Weight bearing upon it, by 
Reason the Step begins by transferring the Weight[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], which is 
accomplished in this Manner: The Body, as has been observed, 
being on the right Foot, immediately before the _Hop_ or first 
Movement is made, is conveyed upon the left and foremost 
Foot, by transferring the Weight, upon which the Hop is given 
on the left Foot, in the right's being taken up from the Ground 
turning a half Turn from the upper Part of the Room to the lower 
End thereof, to the right Hand, making a half Circle in the Air 
the same Way behind the left Foot where it arrives. At the same 
{82} Instant, the Hop is made upon the first Note of the Measure; the 
second is in setting down the said right Foot in the fourth Position 
advanced before the left, on which the Weight rests, in its being 
brought from behind the left Foot, where it mark'd the first Note[[See the first Figure in Plate XII]]. 
The third Note is in the coming down of the _Bound_, which is 
made, as aforesaid, in transferring the Weight from the left to the 
right, the very Moment before the _Spring_ or _Bound_ is made, by 
rising from the Sink or Bending of the Knees, which was on the 
setting down of the right Foot to the second Note, and bringing 
the left Foot on which the Body rested in a low _Bound_ or _Spring_ 
into the third Position behind the right; which being then released 
makes the remaining half Circle in the Air, by turning a half Turn 
more to the same Hand, as in the _Hop_ or first Movement from the 
lower End of the Room to the upper Part, and finishes the Step 
with the right Foot in the Air sideways[[See the second Figure in Plate XV]]. To perform the same 
Step with the other Foot, we are only to set down the right 
Foot into the fifth Position before the left, on which the whole 
Weight rests, which begins, as aforesaid, by transferring the Weight[[See the first Figure in Plate XI]]; 
and the _Hop_ turns a half Turn to the left, exactly as the foregoing 
was described to the right[[See the second Figure in Plate XII. concluding _&c_. as in the first Figure of Plate XV]], _&c_. This Step is to the third Mea[-]
sure of the _Passacaille Diana_, beginning with the same Foot, as 
above described[[See the Tables of this Step in the Plate of Tables mark'd I]].

### {83} CHAP. XXVII. 

### _Of the CHACONNE or PASSACAILLE 
    STEP._

THE _Chaconne_ or _Passacaille Step_ is composed of three Move[-]
ments, _viz_. first a _Bound_, secondly a _Hop_, and lastly a _Bound_, 
or _Balone_, and it is most usually taken from the third Position. 
I shall, as an Example, describe it commencing with the left Foot 
which in its Performance is as follows; that is to say, the left Foot 
disengaged and at Liberty behind the right, in the Position afore[-]
said[[See the second Figure in Plate V]], begins the first Movement by making a _Bound_, in the 
Manner already shewn in treating of that Step, which, as I have 
there said, is accomplished by a Sink or Bending of the Knees; 
from whence the Body is thrown into the Air, in the Spring from 
the Sink or Bending aforesaid, only turning a half Turn to the 
right Hand, and comes down upon the Toe of the left Foot to the 
first Note; at which Instant the right, on which the Weight rested 
before the Change was made, follows or rather attends the left 
Foot, in the same swift Manner as explained in the _Bouree_ and a 
_Bound_, remaining behind the left up in the Air, in order to per[-]
form the Movement that next succeeds, facing to the lower End of 
the Room[[See the second Figure in Plate XIII]]; from which Posture the _Hop_ or second Movement is 
taken, and marks the second Note, by sinking and making a 
_Spring_ or _Hop_ upon the left Foot which supports the Body, turn[-]
ing half a Turn to the right Hand, from the Bottom to the upper 
Part of the Room. The right Foot, which at the End of the 
_Bound_ was behind the left, about the Length of a Step in the Air, 
is now the like Distance before it[[See the second Figure in Plate XIV]], ready to make the _Bound_ 
{84} or _Balone_, as the _French_ call it, to the third Note of the Measure, 
which is in bending both Knees; and, in springing from thence, 
the Weight is transferred from the left Foot, and lights upon the 
Instep or Toe of the right which was in the Air, concluding in the 
third Position, as at commencing[[See the second Figure in Plate V]].

This Step, if continued, always begins with the same Foot, as 
the _Coupee_ or _Bouree with a Bound_; and to perform it with the 
contrary Foot only differs in this, that, instead of being in the third 
Position just described, the Weight must be upon the left Foot, 
with the right at Liberty behind[[See the first Figure in Plate V]]; and, instead of turning to the 
right Hand, it now turns to the left, beginning with the right 
Foot, _&c_.[[See the first Figure in Plate XIII. the first in Plate XIV. and the first in Plate V]] as the foregoing with the left.

This Step, as above explained, is to the fifn[[скорее всего опечатка и должно быть: fifth]] Measure of the _Passa[-]
caille Diana_ aforesaid, and also in the same Measure of the _Passa[-]
caille de Scilla_ mentioned before, commencing with the right Foot; 
and it is a most agreeable Step in _Dancing_, rarely missing to be 
found more than once in one of these Sorts of _Dances_[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables mark'd I, and also the List or Explanation]].

### CHAP. XXVIII.

### _Of the HOP and two CHASSEES or DRIVES 
    round in the same Place._

THE _Hop_ and two _Drives_ or _Chassees_ is likewise a Step com[-]
posed of three Movements, as the Title above specifies, and is 
performed from the fourth Position, in the Manner described in the 
foregoing _Hop_ of two Movements from the fifth Position; which 
{85} said Step begins by transferring the Weight in the like Method as 
the present. Having explained the former, beginning with the 
right Foot, I shall explain this with the contrary, and it is perform[-]
ed as follows, _viz_. the Weight being upon the left Foot, the right 
in the fourth Position advanced and at Liberty is prepared to re[-]
ceive the Body[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]]; which it does, the every Instant before the _Hop_ 
or first Movement is made to the first Note, and from thence, I 
say, begins by sinking or bending of the Knees, in order for the 
following _Spring_ or _Hop_, which is made upon the right Foot, in 
the left's being taken up from the Floor, and marks Time to the 
first Note, as was before observed, turning a half Turn from the 
upper End of the Room to the left Hand and leaving the left Foot 
without Weight, in the third Position behind the right, facing the 
lower End[[See the first Figure in Plate XIII, only the left Foot, instead of being in the Air, must be supposed to rest against the Heel of the right]]; from whence the first of the two _Drives_ begins 
in bending of the Knees, as already shewn in the _Chassee_ or _Driving 
Step_ of three Movements, upon the same Place, in Preparation 
for the _Spring_ or _Bound_ made in straightening of the Knees, turning 
a quarter Turn farther to the left Hand, facing full to the right 
Side of the Room, and lighting upon the left Foot, on its being 
brought into the third Position before the right, which is _drove_ 
by it backwards, the Length of a Step in the Air; which said 
coming down of the left Foot is to the second Note, and the third 
is in the _Spring_ or _Bound_ made upon the right; and, in the Rise or 
Spring from the sinking or bending of the Knees, as aforesaid, 
the right Foot advances into the third Position behind the left, 
which being then released is _drove_, the Length of a Step in the 
Air, turning a quarter Turn more, opening to the left from the 
right Side of the Room to the upper End, and concluding in the 
Air[[See the first Figure in Plate XV]].

To perform this Step with the other Foot only differs in this, 
that, instead of the right Foot, the left Foot must be advanced[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]] 
{86} and, instead of turning the half Turn to the left Hand, as before 
described, it turns to the right, directly in the same Manner as 
the aforesaid[[See the second Figure as aforesaid in Plate XIII, and the second Figure of Plate XV]]; Examples of both which are to be found in the 
_Chaconne de Phaeton_ of Monsieur _Pecours_, in the eighty seventh 
Measure beginning with the right Foot, and in the ninety first of 
the same _Dance_ with the left, as above described[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked I. and also the List or Explanation]].

### CHAP. XXIX.

### _Of the FALL, SPRING with both Feet at the 
    same Time, and COUPEE to a Measure._

THE foregoing Step, ending in the Air with the left Foot, na[-]
turally introduces us to the present, which is of three Move[-]
ments, and taken from thence in _falling_, _springing_ with both Feet 
at the same Time, and a _Coupee_; all which Steps are to be perform[-]
ed to a Measure, and consequently accounted but as one Step, 
which, in its Performance, is as follows, _viz_. the Face or Presence 
of the Body being, as in the foregoing, supposed with the Weight 
upon the right Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate XV, or first Figure of Plate XIV]], the Step begins by falling much in the 
same Manner, as explained in treating of this Step, when intro[-]
duced by the _Galliard_ sideways to the right Hand, only this is 
backwards in a slow and easy Motion, the very same as if you intend[-]
ed to fall quite to the Floor; but, as I said before, it is prevented 
from that by the left Foot which is in the Air, with the Toe point[-]
ed towards the Ground, attending and watching the falling Body 
so narrowly that, the very Instant it is in a manner past Recovery, 
{87} it flies swift to its Relief, to save it from falling, by receiving half 
the Weight in the fourth Position behind the right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate IX, only the Weight must be equally upon one Foot as the other]], with 
the Knees bent upon the first Note; from whence the Spring is im[-]
mediately made with both Feet, acting at the same Juncture upon 
the second Note, that is, by changing the right Foot backwards 
and the left forwards[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], the Knees being bent, as aforesaid, in 
Readiness to make the succeeding _Coupee_; which is done by taking 
up the left or foremost Foot from the Floor and from the Bending 
aforesaid rising upon the Toe or Instep, making an open Step to 
the left Side of the Room to the third Note, neither directly side[-]
ways nor forwards, but between both. The second Step of the 
_Coupee_, which is with the right Foot, follows it, stepping the 
same Way in the like swift Manner, as the Beginning of the _Bou[-]
ree with a Bound_, into the fourth Position before the left[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]], with 
the Knees bent as above.

In order to make the _Half Coupee_, that usually follows this Step, 
which is very slow in that, of itself, it answers to a Bar, like the 
foregoing of three Movements, upon the Weight's being changed, 
the left Foot, which before supported the Body, being at Liberty, 
advances, in rising from the Sink or Bending aforesaid into the 
third Position behind the right[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]], which then is released, and 
makes a Circle in the Air to the second and third Notes, the 
first being upon the left's receiving of the Weight as aforesaid; and 
the _Half Coupee_, concluding thus with the right Foot in the Air, is 
ready to perform either a _Pirouette_, or the same Step over again 
with the contrary Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate XV]]; which only differs from the foregoing, 
in its beginning with the right Foot, and is found in the _Passa[-]
caille de Scilla_, twelve Bars before the End, beginning with the 
last mentioned Foot, and in other Places of the same _Dance_[[See the Table of this Step in the Plate of Tables marked I, and also the List or Explanation]].

### {88} CHAP XXX. 

### _Of the CLOSE beating before and falling behind 
    in the third Position, upright Spring changing to 
    the same before, and COUPEE to a Mea[-]
    sure._

THE _Close beating before &c_. which we are now about to explain, 
differs from the before described Step of this Name, in its be[-]
ing done to the first Note of the Measure, and, instead of resting 
the remaining two Notes, as in the aforesaid to the second, there 
are the _upright Spring_ and _Coupee_ to the third; and, instead of the 
_Close_'s ending either in the first or third Position with the Knees 
straight, as in the former, it here comes down behind with the 
Knees bent, after its beating before. This Step is to be performed 
as follows, viz. commencing either with the right or left Foot 
from the third Position[[See the first and second Figures in Plate V]], by sinking or bending not only the 
foremost Foot on which the Body rests, but likewise the hind Foot 
without Weight; or from thence it begins, by making the _Close_ 
in the like Manner, as aforesaid, in treating of this Step in the Rise 
or Spring from the above named Sink; but, instead of the _Close_'s 
lighting in the first or third Position, as in the foregoing, the be[-]
ginning Leg beats before against that on which the Body rested 
at first[[See the first or inclosed Feet of the first and second Figures in Plate IV]], and comes down in the third Position, as at commen[-]
cing, only the Weight is equally upon both Feet[[See the hind Feet of the two said Figures in Plate IV]], and the Knees 
are bent, marking the first Note. The second, as I have observed, 
{89} is in coming down after the Rise or _upright Spring_ from thence 
into the Air, in which the Feet are changed, _viz_. the first last 
and the last first[[See the Change in the first and second and second and first Figures in Plate IV]], the Knees being bent, as aforesaid, upon the 
first Note in Preparation to make the following _Coupee_, which is 
swift upon the third and last Note of the Measure, whether of a _Sa[-]
raband or Passacaille_, _&c_. by rising in the Step the first Foot 
makes forwards, opening either to the right or left Hand and re[-]
ceiving the Weight[[See the two first or advanced Feet in the Figures of Plate IX]]; after which the hind Foot and second Step 
of the _Coupee_ move swift, the same Way, into the fourth Position 
before[[See the right or advanced Foot in the second Figure of Plate IX, and the left or advanced Foot of the first Figure in the same Plate]] it, with the Knees bent, concluding in Readiness for the 
_Coupee_ that usually attends these Steps; which is, as I have said, 
in the last described Step, as exceeding slow as the foregoing or 
its Introducer was quick, and made in rising from the aforesaid 
after transferring the Weight, and bringing the hind Foot into 
the third Position behind the foremost[[See the second and first Figures in Plate IV]], which being released 
makes a Circle in the Air, as aforesaid, either to the right or left 
Hand, according to which Foot the Step begun with[[See the Figures in Plate XV]], and is 
ready to perform the Step over again with the contrary Foot to that 
with which you commence.

You are to take Notice, that these two Steps are in a Manner 
inseparable, as I have already observed of some others in the 
Beginning of this Discourse, and are to the last Measure excepting 
two and a half of the _Spanish Entree_ for _two Men_, composed by 
Monsieur _Pecour_, belonging to the _Opera de l' Europ Galante_; and 
also in the _Entree Espagnole_ for a _Man_ and a _Woman_, in the afore[-]
said _Opera_, composed by the same Master[[See the twenty first Table in the Plate of Tables marked I, and the List or Explanation of the said Table]].

The above described Step is sometimes performed, turning a 
whole Turn round, that is to say, half a Turn upon the _Close_ beat[-]
ing before and coming down behind in the third Position, the o[-]
ther {90} half being in the _upright Spring_; and instead of the _Beat_'s be[-]
ing made against the Foot on which the Weight rested, when fa[-]
cing the upper End of the Room, it is here made to the lower 
Part in a half Turn, either to the right or left Hand, lighting in 
the third Position behind; from whence the _upright Spring_ is ta[-]
ken, in rising or springing from the Floor, as aforesaid, only, in[-]
stead of the Feet being changed facing the Bottom of the Room, 
the remaining half Turn is made to the same Hand up it: For Ex[-]
ample, suppose it commences with the right Foot from behind[[See the first Figure in Plate V]], 
then the Turn must be to the left, the _Close_ ending to the lower 
End in the third Position, with the right Foot behind[[See the first Figure in Plate IV. and for the Beat before see the second Figure in the same Plate, only the Feet must be supposed in the third Position down the Room]]; but, 
in the half Turn belonging to the _upright Spring_, it is changed in 
the Air, and comes down in the third Position before the left, on 
which the Body rested at first[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]].

The _Coupee_ is intirely the same, as described in the foregoing, 
beginning from the first or inclosed Foot; and, if with the left 
Foot, it begins in the same Manner, by making a _Spring_ or _Close_, 
_&c_. turning to the right, as above[[See the twenty second Table in the Plate of Tables mark'd E and the List or Explanation of the said Table]].

### CHAP. XXXI.

### _Of the PIROUETTE._

THE _Pirouette_ is a Step that altogether consists of Motion and 
Turning. There are two different Ways of performing it; 
either from a whole Position, the Weight resting on both Feet; or 
a half Position, when the Weight only rests upon one Foot, the o[-]
ther being in the Air, from whence it begins, as will appear: For 
{91} instead of performing it from the fifth Position, directly as we 
stand, as in the former, in the latter it is made by adding a Step 
with the Foot in the Air backwards into the abovementioned Posi[-]
tion behind, from whence they turn equally alike to either Hand 
upon the same Place, the Weight of the Body resting mostly upon 
that Foot which at first supported the Weight, the Difference be[-]
ing only in the stepping of the Foot which may as well be made 
forwards as backwards.

I shall now proceed to explain the Method of performing this 
Step, both these Ways, beginning in the first Place with the whole 
Position, which is as follows, _viz_. being, as was already observed, 
in the fifth Position, that is to say, when the Heel of either the 
right or left Foot, instead of being advanced right forwards, as in 
the fourth Position, is, as I have before shewn in the _Hop_ of two 
Movements, round in two half Turns from the Position now treat[-]
ed on, and about the Length of half a Foot more cross'd before the 
hindmost Foot; so as that the Heel of the first in a Manner touches 
the Toe of the hind Foot, the Weight of the Body bearing as much 
upon one Foot, as the other, instead of the whole Weight's being 
upon the Foot which is behind, as in the _Hop_ of two Movements[[See the first and second Figures of Plate XI]].

Having shewn the Position or Posture of standing, from whence 
this Step is taken, I will continue its Explanation, turning to either 
Side of the Room; and it is no more than making a Sink or Bend[-]
ing of the Knees in the above explain'd Position, the Rise whereof 
is made upon both Insteps to the first Note, in binding or pres[-]
sing them strong to the Floor and raising the Body into the Air, 
during the Turning or Measure to which it is made: For Instance, 
if to the right, the left Foot is foremost[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], if to the left the 
right[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]] From the last of these we shall describe it, as follows: 
The Sink and Rise being made, as aforesaid, to the first Note, 
the second and third, if to triple Time, are in the slow Turning of 
the quarter Turn, which is to the left Side of the Room, in which 
{92} the Feet are changed; namely, the right, which at commencing 
was first, is now last, and the left first, facing full the Side of 
the Room to which the Turn was made; and, if a half Turn, it is 
only adding a quarter Turn more, which then will be full to the 
Bottom of the Room; and, if a three quarter Turn, it continues 
on to the right Side of the Room a quarter Turn further.

It is also to be observed, that, if a quarter Turn be to a Measure, 
the second and third Notes are counted, during the Turning or 
_Pirouette_; the same, if a half or three quarter Turn; or, if to 
common Time, the same as already shewn in many Places of 
this Discourse. And, if it be a whole Turn, it is intirely the like 
in Relation to the Notes, but not in its Method of Performance; 
for, instead of the Body's bearing equally upon both Toes, as above, 
it now bears, in rising from the Sink or Preparative for the whole 
Turn, upon the Heel of one Foot and Toe of the other: For In[-]
stance, in the rising, as aforesaid, or marking the Time, the 
Weight bears half upon the Heel of the right or foremost Foot and 
the Toe of the Foot that is behind, in which Manner it turns to 
the left, as before, as far as the Bottom or lower End of the Room; 
at which Time the Toe of the fore Foot and Heel of the hind 
come to the Floor, continuing the Turn, 'till you arrive to the up[-]
per End of the Room or Place of setting out, and finish in a 
Readiness to perform the same to the other Hand if Occasion re[-]
quires, by Reason of the Feet being changed, as I have said, in 
the middle of the Turn or setting down the Heel of the hind Foot 
and Toe of the foremost[[See the contrary Figures in Plate XI. that is to say, for the first see the second, and for the second see the first Figure]]. Both the Ways of performing this 
Step, as above explained, turning a whole Round, are to be found 
in the fourth Bar of the _Saraband_ belonging the _Royal Galiard_, 
composed by the late Mr. _Isaac_, and written by Mr. _De la Gard_, 
the second Time of its playing; the foregoing three quarter Turn, 
in the short _Saraband_ for a _Man_, composed by Mr. _Pecour_, in his 
Collection of _Dances_ published at _Paris_, in the Year 1704, by 
{93} Mr. _Feuillet_, the thirteenth and fifteenth Bars before the End of 
the said _Dance_; and the quarter and half Turns are to be met 
with in most _Dances_[[See the twenty fourth Table in the Plate of Tables mark'd I. and also the List or Explanation of the said Table]]. I shall now proceed to describe the se[-]
cond Way in which this _Pirouette_ is taken and performed, _viz_. 
from a half Position instead of a whole, as was, for Example, the 
foregoing; that is to say, when the Weight of the Body is either 
upon the right or left Foot, and the other open in the Air pointed 
sideways, as in the _March_, or about an Inch or two more for[-]
wards, only it does not touch the Floor, as in that, by Reason of 
its being the commencing Foot; from whence it begins, by ma[-]
king a Step backwards into the fourth Position, if it be a quarter 
or half Turn; but, if a three quarter or whole Turn, it must be 
made into the fifth, as aforesaid, all of which are performed di[-]
rectly in the same Manner, as the foregoing or whole Position, by 
dividing the Weight, at the End of the stepping backwards of the 
Foot that was in the Air, which, upon setting it to the Ground, 
receives so much of the Weight as only serves to direct and assist the 
Body in turning, as well as marking the Time, as aforesaid, in 
rising from the Sink made for that Purpose, on the stepping of the 
Foot backwards upon both Toes, and turning either to the right or 
left Hand, which is according to the Foot that is in the Air, for 
the Turn must be made to the same Side; for Example, if the right 
Foot be in the Air, the Turn is to that Side[[See the second Figure in Plate XV]]; and if the left, it 
is to the left[[See the first Figure in Plate XV]].

Having explained the foregoing or whole Position, turning to 
the left Hand, the taking some Notice of it to the right may not 
be improper, in this Place, beginning with the quarter Turn: 
For Instance, the Weight being upon the half Position or left Foot, 
the right, extended as aforesaid[[See the second Figure in the same Plate]], begins in making a Sink or 
Bending of the Knee of the left Leg on which the Body rests; at 
which Instant the right is cast back, as was said above, into the 
{94} fourth Position behind the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]], and preparing for the Rise 
marks the first Note, which is made on setting down or receiving 
a Part of the Poise of the Body upon the Foot that was in the Air; 
from whence the Turn takes its Rise, turning in a slow and gen[-]
tle Turn to the right Side of the Room, and bearing or pressing the 
Toes to the Floor, as we have already shewn in the foregoing, in 
which Turning the second and third Notes are spent; that is to 
say, the second Note is counted in changing of the Feet, which is 
in the Turning, as I have said, for the right Foot, which was in 
the fourth Position behind, is about the second Note in the same 
Position before the left, facing full the right Side of the Room; 
and the third Note is upon setting down the Heel of the left Foot, 
and taking up the right, which is extended open sideways, as at 
first, and concludes.

A _Pirouette_ with a half or three quarter Turn only differs 
from the _Pirouette_ just explained, in not ending to the right Side 
as in that; but, instead thereof, the half Turn finishes to the 
lower Part of the Room, half a Turn from the upper End[[See the first Figure in Plate XII]]. 
And the three quarter Turn continues on, 'till it face full the left 
Side; but the whole Turn, as I have said in the _Pirouette_, be[-]
ginning from a whole or half Position, on which the Weight is 
equally divided, instead of rising upon both Toes alike, at the 
End of the Step made with the right Foot, by sinking and stepping 
backwards, as before observed, into the fifth Position behind the 
left Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], in the Rise or Beginning of the Turn the right Toe 
or Instep, being set down to the Ground in the Position just men[-]
tioned, receives one half of the Weight, the other remaining 
upon the Heel of the left on which the Body rested at first. In the 
said Manner half the Turn is made to the Bottom of the Room, 
bearing equally upon the Heel and Toe; and, when it arrives 
there, the remaining half is continued, by putting down the right 
Heel and Toe of the left Foot, which at first begun upon the 
{95} Heel, as the right did upon the Toe, about which Time the Feet 
are changed, as we have observed; that is, the right, which was 
stepp'd or сast into the fifth Position behind, is now first, and the 
left last, concluding with both Feet flat on the Floor, the Presence 
of the Body being to the upper End of the Room, as at commen[-]
cing[[See the first Figure in Plate XI. And, if beginning with the left Foot, see the first Figure in Plate XV, and the first and second Figures in Plate XI]].

As to the Agreement of this Step with the Notes of common or 
triple Time, it is the same as already explained in the _Pirouette_ 
beginning from the whole Position; the only Difference is, that 
the Weight in that, being equally on both Feet, begins directly 
by making a Sink and Rise, the Rise of which beats Time to the 
first Note of the Tune, which is the same in this Step, except that 
the Body, being supported by a half Position, before it can begin 
as in the whole Position, the other Foot which is in the Air must 
be cast or set down in the fourth or fifth Position; from whence 
this Step is usually taken, in stepping either forwards or backwards, 
as the Step is to be made. The remaining second and third Notes 
of the Measure, if to triple Time, are counted, during the said Turning, 
a whole Round; or, if to common Time, the fourth is included, 
as has been observed.

This Step, in its Performance _forwards_, is in all Respects the 
same as the last described _backwards_, as to its Agreement with the 
Notes, or its Rising, Turning on the Toes, _&c_. only whereas, in 
the two foregoing _Pirouettes_, the Manner of performing the whole 
Turn is not the same as the quarter, half, or three quarter Turn, 
in this the whole Turn is done in the same Method as the rest, ex[-]
cept that the Step is made _forwards_ into the fourth or fifth Position, 
instead of _backwards_ as in the last explained; and, as I have already 
observed in the foregoing Steps, if the Turn be only a quarter or 
half Turn, it commences from the fourth Position[[See the second Figure in Plate IX, beginning from the second Figure in Plate XV. And, if with the contrary, see the first Figure in Plate XV, and the first Figure in Plate IX]], but if a three 
{96} quarter or whole Turn the fifth[[See the first Figure in Plate XI, commencing from the second Figure in Plate XV; and, if with the other Foot, see the first Figure in the aforesaid Plate XV, and it concludes in the second Figure of the aforesaid Plate XI]]. This Step _forwards_ farther 
varies from the foregoing _backwards_, in that, altho' it commences 
with the same Foot, instead of turning to the right Hand, as in 
the former, in this it turns to the left, as in the whole Position; 
so that, comparing this with the _Pirouette_ first described, it will be 
easily understood, in that it is the same, except in not beginning 
directly, as in that; but if you suppose the stepping of the Foot 
_forwards_ to be made, and place your Feet in the fourth or fifth 
Position, as before observed from a whole Position, there is then 
no other Difference, except that the whole Turn is performed in 
the same Method as the other[[See the twenty fifth Table in the Plate of Tables mark'd E, the List or Explanation of the said Table, and also the Steps contained in Plate XV]].

### CHAP. XXXII.

### _Of the PIROUETTE introduced by a COU[-]
    PEE._

THIS Step is taken from a half Position, as well as the two 
last described _backwards_ and _forwards_; but, instead of the 
Foot's being extended sideways in the Air, as in them, the Toe 
must here be pointed to the Floor, as in the Point or Beginning 
of the _March_, from which Position it commences.

However, before I proceed to a farther Explanation of this Step, 
I shall take some Notice of the _Coupee_ that introduces it, which is 
composed of a _Half Coupee_ with one Foot and a circular Motion 
made in the Air with the other, before its making the Point; 
which Step may be performed as follows, beginning with either 
{97} Foot, by sinking and making a _Half Coupee_ or Step forwards, 
marking Time to the first Note, in rising from thence.

If we suppose this Step to be made with the right Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate I]], the 
circular Step or Motion with the left must then be made inwards 
to the second and third Notes, or the fourth, if common Time; 
that is to say, the _Half Coupee_ being made with the right Foot, 
as aforesaid, the whole quarter of the left Leg moving in the Air, 
with the Knee stiff and Toe pointed, makes a circular Motion, by 
moving directly off sideways, as in the _Point_ for a _March_[[See the first Figure in Plate XV]], 
only more round continuing on forwards, about that Distance from 
the other, forming a Sort of a Circle in the Air before the right 
Foot on which the Body rests all this Time, in bringing the left 
Leg, as above directed, that is to say, the Toe pointed and Knee 
stiff into the third Position, so as to touch the Ancle of the right 
Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate IV]]; and then it passes on directly sideways to the left Hand 
making a _Point_, about the like Distance from the Foot you stand 
upon as the _March_[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]]; from whence proceeds the _Pirouette_ we 
are about to treat of, which is performed by making an easy Sink 
or Bending of both Knees preparing for the Rise or Straightening 
of them, which resembles a Spring, only it is not from the Ground; 
for, in the Rise or Spring from the Sink aforesaid preparing for the 
whole Round, the left Foot which was upon the _Point_ is taken 
up from the Ground, turning quite round to the left Hand in 
the Air, with the Leg or whole Quarter extended in the Air, 
the Toe pointed, and Knee stiff, as in the circular Motion, 
about half a Foot from the Floor[[See the first Figure in Plate XV. If with the other Foot, see the second Figure in Plate I, the second Figure in Plate XV, the second Figure in Plates IV and VI, and lastly the second Figure in the aforesaid Plate XV]]. The Body, at the very Juncture 
the Rise or Spring is given, rises upon the Toe or Instep, as erect 
as a _Pyramid_, and turns round along with it, finishing to the up[-]
per Part of the Room as at first, only with the Toe in the Air; 
{98} from whence it may be continued as the _Half Coupee_, or _Bou[-]
ree_, _&c_.

This Step usually takes up a Measure, whether of three or four 
Notes to the Bar; the Rise or Spring to the _Pirouette_ marks the 
first Note, and the rest are in the Turning; but the _Coupee_ and 
_Pirouette_, tho' frequently found together, are in themselves di[-]
stinct Steps[[See the twenty seventh Table in the Plate of Tables marked I, and the List or Explanation of the said Table]].

There are various other Ways of performing this Step, besides 
the described, as twice _round_, three Times _round, round_ in an up[-]
right Spring beating before and behind during the Turning, and 
many more; which, as they are foreign to my present Purpose, I 
shall omit, and say something of the _Bouree before and behind, turn[-]
ing_, _&c_.

### CHAP. XXXIII.

### _Of the BOUREE before and behind, and behind 
    and before, advancing in a whole Turn._

THIS Step is composed of two _Bourees_; but, tho' in _Dancing_ 
it may be performed to all Parts of the Room, or upon a Cir[-]
cle, an Explanation of it, commencing with the right Foot ad[-]
vancing to the Presence or upper Part of the Room, shall suffice, 
in that the rest will be comprehended thereby, since the Difference 
is only instead of facing, as aforesaid. The Presence or Body, for 
Example, must be directed to the Part or Side of the Room, to 
which the Step is made; whether to the right or left Hand, low[-]
er End, or on a circular Figure, it will be the very same, except 
that, advancing to the said Parts, as before, upon a right or 
straight Line, you must perform the said Step circularly or round, 
{99} commencing either with the right or left Foot, as it shall fall out, 
from any of the aforesaid Parts of the Room. This will appear 
from the following, which, as I have above observed, is advancing 
to the upper End of the Room with the right Foot, in order to 
which the Weight must be upon the left, with the right disenga[-]
ged and at Liberty in the first Position[[See the first Figure in Plate I]], which begins in making 
a Movement or Bending of the Knees; from whence the right 
makes the first Step of the three that compose the first of the two 
_Bourees_ up the Room[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate IX, only it is to turn as directed]], in stepping crossways before the left, on 
which the Body turns a quarter Turn to the right Side of the Room, 
the Rise of which, whether upon the Toe or Heel, marks the 
Time or first Note. The second Note is in the next Step with 
the left Foot, on its receiving the Weight, which it does, after ma[-]
king a Step circularly before the right, in a quarter Turn more, 
now facing full to the Bottom of the Room[[See in some Respects the first Figure in Plate VIII, only the right Toe must be, as directed, upon the Point]]; and the third and 
last Step with the right, which is now upon the Point in the fourth 
Position before the left, concludes the first _Bouree_, in pressing or 
sliding the Toe against the Floor into the same Position behind the 
left, receiving the Weight upon the third Note of the Measure, 
and leaving the left Foot upon the _Point_ in the like Manner[[See the second Figure in Plate XII, except that the left Toe must be pointed as directed]].

The first _Bouree_ being thus ended, the second also begins with 
a Movement or Bending of the Knees, as aforesaid; from whence 
the left is stepped or cast behind the right, in turning a quarter 
Turn farther, which will then be to the left Side of the Room, the 
Rise of which is to the first Note or Time to a second Measure; 
and the second Step of this _Bouree_ is with the right Foot, turning 
the fourth or last quarter Turn from the left Side of the Room to 
the upper Part or Presence thereof, the setting down or receiving 
of the Body upon which is to the second Note. The third Note is 
in the last Step of the Bouree made with the left, directly up the 
{100} Room; and upon its receiving the Weight the second _Bouree_ is 
ended, concluding in the first Position, as at commencing.

The foregoing Step, as above described, consists of two plain _Bou[-]
rees_ or _Fleurets_ of one Movement only, whereas it frequently is per[-]
formed with two; and if so, the second must be made upon the 
third Step, whether on the Ground or off from thence as in a 
_Bound_, as has already been explained in treating of these Steps.

But sometimes in _Dancing_, instead of the second _Bouree_, a 
_Coupee_ is found commencing with either Foot, as it shall happen; 
but here it is with the left crossing before the right Foot on which 
the Body rests[[See the second Figure in Plate XII]], in a quarter Turn from the lower End of the 
Room to the left Side, or in a half Turn to the Presence, the right 
Foot or second Step of which is set to the Ground, in the Method 
as when introducing a Hop[[See the second Figure in Plate X]], or, instead of the _Coupee_ aforesaid, 
as in the seventh and eighth Measures of the first Couplet of a _Dance_ 
of my own Composition, named the _Submission_, that is to say, on 
the _Woman's_ Side. The left Foot not _coupeeing_ before the right, 
as above, instead thereof, in turning a half Turn, receives the 
Weight, in rising from the Sink or Bending of the Knees in the 
third Position behind the right[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]], which then is taken from the 
Floor, making a circular Motion in the Air opening to the right[[See the second Figure in Plate XV]] 
and inclosed in the third Position behind the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IV]], as in the two 
first Measures of the second Couplet of the aforesaid _Dance_ on the 
_Man_'s Side; and if the said Steps are with the other Foot, as on 
the _Woman_'s, the same Method of Performance is to be observed 
to the left Side of the Room, as in the foregoing to the right[[See the second Figure in Plate I. See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate IX, only turning to the left. See in some Respects the second Figure in Plate VIII, only the left Toe is pointed. See the first Figure in Plate XII, the first Figure in Plate X, the first Figure in Plate IV, the first Figure in Plate XV, and the second Figure in Plate IV. See the twenty ninth Table in the Plate of Tables mark'd I, and also the List or Explanation of the Characters of this Step]]. I 
{101} have been the more particular in describing these Steps, because 
they are of more than ordinary Grace and Variety to _Dancing_; 
but I shall now proceed to the _Minuet_, the Subject of the _second 
Book_ of this Work.

### CHAP. I.

### _Of the MINUET STEP._ 

THE _Minuet Step_ is composed of four plain straight 
Steps or Walks, and may be performed forwards, 
backward, sideways, _&c_. four different Ways, to which 
there are the like Number of Names annexed, to di[-]
stinguish them from one another, arising, not impro[-]
perly speaking, from the Placing of the Marks upon them: For Ex[-]
ample, a Movement or Sink and Rise, being added to the first Step 
of the three belonging to the _Minuet Step_, produces a _Bouree_; and 
{104} the like to the fourth and last a _Half Coupee_, which together com[-]
pose what is commonly called the _English Minuet Step_.

The second Method of its Performance is with a _Bound_; that is [-]
to say, instead of the _Half Coupee_ or Movement to the last Step 
made upon the Floor, as in the aforesaid, you _bound_ instead there[-]
of, which is the only Variation from the foregoing.

The third Method is quite the Reverse, because, instead of the 
_Bouree_, the _Half Coupee_ is made first and afterwards the _Bouree_, or 
as the _French_ term it, _One and a Fleuret_, which is usually called 
the _French_ Step. 

The fourth Way of performing this Step is, by adding another 
Movement to the third Step of the aforesaid _Fleuret_, or the fourth 
of the _Minuet Step_; and it will then be notwithstanding the same 
Step, only of three Movements. As to the two first foregoing Steps, 
I shall say little concerning them, for the following Reasons: In 
the first Place, because they are now rarely, if ever, practised a[-]
mongst Persons of the first Rank, and seem to be, for the present, 
intirely laid aside; not as being ungraceful, or that the _Dancer_ 
could not give Pleasure to the Beholders, or raife to himself a Re[-]
putation, in their Performance, but merely through Alteration of 
Fashion, which varies in this Respect, as in Dressing, _&c_.

Secondly, because they have been, in some Measure, already ex[-]
plained in the Beginning of this Book by the _Bouree_ and a _Bound_, 
which, from what I then observed, appears to be the same as the 
_Minuet Step_ here treated on, except that it there answers to a Measure 
or Bar, but here to two, as the Time is much brisker than in the 
aforesaid slow Movements; and, as to their Agreement with the 
Notes, it is very different from what I have to say, upon that 
Head, to the two last Steps following; the first of which is the third 
of the aforesaid, namely _One and a Fleuret_, or a _Half Coupee_ and 
_Bouree_, usually called the _New Minuet Step_, and the same that is 
now _danced_ in all polite Assemblies[[See the Characters of this Step in the Plate marked O, Number I. Table the second]]. As it is become the _fa[-]
vourite_ Step, my being somewhat more particular in its Description, 
{105} than of the foregoing, may not be lost Time; for the _Minuet_ is 
one of the most graceful as well as difficult _Dances_ to arrive at a 
Mastery of, through the Plainness of the Step and the Air and Ad[-]
dress of the Body that are requisite to its Embellishment, as will 
farther appear from the Sequel.

But to return to the Subject in Hand; having, I say, already ob[-]
served, that the _Minuet Step_ is composed of four plain Steps, with[-]
out shewing the Method of their Performance, or their Agreement 
with the Notes of the Tune, I shall now proceed to describe both 
of these, which are to be accomplished in the following Manner: 
The Weight of the Body being upon the left Foot in the first Po[-]
sition the right, which is at Liberty[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], begins the _Minuet Step_, 
by making the _Half Coupee_ or first of the four Steps belonging to 
the _Minuet_, in a Movement or Sink and Stepping of the right Foot 
forwards[[See the second Figure in Plate IX, Book I]], the gentle or easy Rising of which, either upon the 
Toe or Heel, marks what is called _Time_ to the first Note of the 
three in the first of the two Measures, which is of triple Time or of 
three Notes to a Bar; the second Note is in the coming down of 
the Heel to the Floor[[See the second Figure in Plate I, Book I]], if the Rise was made upon the Toe, but 
if upon the Heel or flat Foot, in the tight Holding of the Knees 
before the Sink is made that prepares for the _Fleuret_ or _Bouree_ fol[-]
lowing, in which is counted the third and last Note of the Measure 
aforesaid; and the said _Bouree_ or second Part of the _Minuet Step_, 
if I may so say, is made upon the second Measure of the Tune, as 
the _Half Coupee_ was to the first, so that it is visible, from what 
has been said before, that one _Minuet Step_ is of equal Value to two 
Measures or Bars of the Tune.

The Sink or Beginning of the Movement, that prepares for the 
_Fleuret_ or second Part of the _Minuet Step_, for so I shall for the fu[-]
ture call it, being made, there only remains to rise from the 
Sink aforesaid in the stepping forwards of the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate IX, Book I]] to the 
{106} first Note of the second Measure, and first of the _Fleuret_ or three 
last Steps of the four that compose the _Minuet Step_; the second 
Step of the said _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_ is made, swift forwards with the 
right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate IX, Book I]], to the same Note; and the third and last Step of 
the _Bouree_, or second Part of the _Minuet Step_ with the left Foot[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]], 
is to the third and last Note of the same Measure of the Tune, 
concluding the _Minuet Step_ with the Weight upon the said Foot, 
as at first[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]]. It is to be noted, that it always begins with the 
right and ends with the left Foot; and it is performed faster or 
slower, according to the Tune that is played, which the _Dancer_ is 
obliged to follow.

Having described the foregoing Step _forwards_, I shall now pro[-]
ceed in it _sideways_ to either Hand; and, in the first Place, to 
the right Side of the Room, or rather obliquely, that is to say, 
from the upper left Corner of the Room to the right lower facing to 
the upper right Corner of it, or rather in the Middle between di[-]
rectly sideways facing the upper End of the Room and, as said a[-]
bove, from Corner to Corner: For Example, instead of the left 
Side to the upper Corner and the right to the lower, the left Side or 
Shoulder points about the Middle of the upper left Corner and 
sideways directly cross the Room; which will be easily understood 
by a supposed Line across the Room, for the right Shoulder conse[-]
quently pointing the same Way below the Line, instead of facing 
the right upper Corner, as before, is now to the Middle or Space 
between the said Corner and directly up the Room; which will 
likewise be comprehended, by supposing a right Line up the Floor, 
and the Face a little turn'd looking towards the left Shoulder, or, 
more properly speaking, upon the _Gentleman_ or _Lady_ with whom 
we _dance_; and the said Turn, or rather Complaisance gives a most 
agreeable Twist or Contrast to the Fashion of the Body in this Step, 
and not a little Beauty to that Part of the _Minuet Dance_ upon which 
it falls[[See the Gentleman and Lady in Plate VI]]; but of that more hereafter.

{107} Having described the Action or Posture of the Body in 
which this Step must be performed, if to Advantage, I shall pro[-]
ceed in explaining the Motion or Stepping of the Feet upon the 
aforesaid Tract or Line; which is _sideways_ to the right Hand, in[-]
stead of _forwards_, as in the foregoing, which is the principal Dif[-]
ference[[See the Characters of this Step in the second Table of the Plate marked O, Number II]]. However, as it may not in all Probability be so fully 
comprehended by what has been said in the foregoing Step, it 
may not be improper to take some farther Notice of it in this Place, 
_viz_. That it is to be taken from the first Position, that is to say, 
the Weight being upon the left Foot the right, which is at Liber[-]
ty[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I. For the Action or Posture of the Body see the Gentleman and Lady in Plate VI]], commences by making a Sink and Step, open off from the 
left Foot, on which the Body rests, _sideways_ to the right[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate VI. Book I]]. 
The Rise of the Sink marks Time to the first of the three Notes; 
and the rest are the same, as when done _forwards_, the _Half Cou[-]
pee_ or first Part of the _Minuet Step_ being made to the first Mea[-]
sure of the Tune, as aforesaid, ending in the same Position upon 
the right Foot, with the left disengaged[[See the second Figure in Plate I, Book aforesaid. Action as at beginning]] to perform the _Bou[-]
ree_ or second Part of the said Step _sideways_, in like Manner as in 
the foregoing _forwards_; which it does in making a Sink and Step 
to the right Hand _sideways_ crossing behind the right on which 
the Body rests[[See the first Figure in Plate XI, Book I. Action the same]], the Rise of which is to the first Note of the se[-]
cond Measure. The right Foot then makes a plain open Step, 
_sideways_ to the same Hand[[See the second Figure in Plate VI]], upon the second Note, leaving the 
left upon the _Point_, in the very Place the Body rested before, in 
Readiness to make the second Step, and is about the Distance of 
a _Point_ in the _March_[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]]; upon which the third and last Step of the 
_Bouree_ and _Minuet Step_ is made to the third Note of the second 
Measure of the Tune, by drawing the left Foot, pointed as it is 
firm to the Floor into the fifth Position behind the right[[See the first Figure in Plate XI, Book I]], re[-]
ceiving {108} the Body, and concludes in the first Position, as at first[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]]; 
and it may be continued, as long as the _Dancer_ pleases.

The third and last Method of performing this Step is as follows: 
Instead of obliquely, as in the last explained to the right Hand, it 
is here diametrically or sideways crossing the Room directly to the 
left Hand, facing, not as in the aforesaid, but instead thereof full 
either up or down the Room, as it shall happen[[See the Characters of this Step in the second Table of the Plate marked O, Number III]].

This Step, in Performance, differs from the last described in 
this, that the right or beginning Foot, which before made the 
_Half Coupee_ off to the right, now instead thereof makes a Sink and 
Step sideways to the left Hand, crossing behind the left Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate XI. Book aforesaid]], 
which supports the Body, marking Time to the first Note of the 
same Measure, and filling up the remaining second and third Notes, 
intirely the like as in the foregoing, except that, instead of the 
first Position as in them, it here ends in the third with the left Foot 
foremost or inclosed at Liberty to perform the _Bouree_, in the same 
Manner to the left Side of the Room, as before to the right[[See the first Figure in Plate IV, Book I]]. 
The said _Bouree_ or second Part of the _Minuet Step_ begins, by ma[-]
king a Sink and open Step, off sideways from the right on which 
the Weight rests to the left Hand[[See in some Degree the first Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], the Rise or Receiving of the 
Body upon which marks Time to the first Note of the second Mea[-]
sure, and the right Foot makes the second Step of the _Bouree_ to 
the second Note, in drawing it pointed[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book aforesaid]] crossing behind the left[[See the second Figure in Plate XI, Book I]], 
from the Place where it supported the Weight, before the 
first Step of the _Fleuret_ was made; and the third and last Step of 
the _Bouree_ and fourth of the _Minuet Step_ is made, by stepping the 
left Foot open off from the right[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate VI, the same Book]], in like Manner as the com[-]
mencing of the _Fleuret_, only without a Sink, ending in the first 
Position, as at the Beginning of the Step, upon the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], 
{109} which Step may be continued either diametrically or circularly, as 
Occasion offers.

We are now arrived at the fourth and last of the before men[-]
tioned Steps, namely, that of _three Movements_ or Bendings and 
Risings; which is also commonly called the _New Step_, from its 
being used now as much, or very little less than the last explained 
of _two Movements_ only, and more especially when performed to the 
left Hand sideways before and behind, in that it composes a Part of 
the _Minuet Dance_, as now practised, of which I shall have Occa[-]
sion to speak more particularly hereafter.

In the Interim I shall proceed in describing the present _Minuet 
Step of three Movements_, which, as I have already said, is only the 
Addition of a Movement or a Sink and Rise more to the last Step 
of the _Bouree_ or second Part of the _Minuet Step_; yet it will require 
a farther Explanation, by Reason that it differs very much from the 
last explained, in its Agreement with the Notes of the Tune; for, 
tho' that may properly be divided into two Parts or Divisions 
through the _Half Coupee_, in that it, together with the Sink which 
prepares for the succeeding _Bouree_, answers to the first Measure of 
the Tune, and the _Fleuret_ or second Part of the _Minuet Step_ to the 
second, and consequently is of equal Value, tho' no more than a 
single Step, with the other three remaining, it is not the like here, 
because the four Steps that compose the _Minuet Step_ are partly of 
an equal Space or Distance one from the other, as in counting of 
one, two, three, four, and cannot so justly be divided into two 
Parts as the foregoing, which notwithstanding is but one _Minuet 
Step_, as I have said before, separated for the more familiar and 
easy comprehending thereof; which said Advantage we must lose 
in this Step, it being so intirely of a Piece that a Division here 
would be as unnatural, as the aforesaid is natural, as will appear 
by the Description I am about to give of it, which in the first Place 
shall be _forwards_[[See the Characters of this Step in the second Table of the Plate marked O, Number I. A Sink and Rise must be supposed]]; and it is to be performed in this Manner.
{110} For Example, the Weight of the Body being upon the left Foot 
in the first Position, the right disengaged and free[[See the first Figure in Plate I]] begins, as a[-]
foresaid, in making a Sink and Step forwards directly up the Room[[See the second Figure in Plate IX. in some Measure]]. 
The Rising or Receiving the Weight upon the Toe or Instep marks 
the Time to the first Note of the three belonging to the first Mea[-]
sure; the second is in the Fall of the Heel[[See the second Figure in Plate I]] and Sink which pre[-]
pares for the second Step of the four belonging to the _Minuet Step_, 
which is made by stepping of the left Foot forwards, in the same 
Manner as the first[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]; and the Rising or Receiving of the Body 
upon the Instep is to the third and last Note of the first Measure. 
The third Step of the said four is made with the right Foot step[-]
ping a plain straight Step forwards[[See the second Figure in Plate IX]] upon the Toe to the first 
Note of the three in the second Measure; the second is in the co[-]
ming down of the Heel of the said right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate I]] and Sink that 
prepares for the fourth and last Step which is with the left Foot, 
in stepping forwards from the Sink aforesaid[[See the first Figure in Plate IX]]; and the Rising or 
Receiving of the Weight upon the Toe is to the third Note of the 
second Measure of the Tune, concluding in the same Position from 
whence it begun[[See the first Figure in Plate I]], in Order for a Continuance, which may be 
either more or less, according to the Largeness or Smallness of the 
Room in which the _Dance_ is performed.

The two other Ways in which this Step is performed are _diame[-]
trically_ or _sideways_; the first of which[[See the Characters of this Step in the second Table of the Plate marked O, Number IV]] is in the like Manner as 
the _Minuet Step_ of two Movements, or _One_ and a _Fleuret_, to the 
left Side of the Room, that is to say, the right Foot always cros[-]
sing behind the left; but as I have already in that Step described 
the Method in which the Feet are to be stepped, it will be need[-]
less at present to say any more than to shew its Difference in count[-]
ing to the Notes, from the former, which from what I have said 
{111} above appears to be very different from the Step now treated on, as 
I shall endeavour to demonstrate by the following Particulars.

In the first Place, we are to suppose a Movement added to the 
last Step of the _Bouree_, or second Part of the _Minuet Step_, and the 
first Step with the right Foot[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate XI]] to be made upon the Toe to the 
first Note; the second is in the coming down of the Heel[[See the first Figure in Plate VI]] and 
Sink upon the right Foot, which prepares for the second Step made 
with the left[[See in some Measure the first Figure of Plate VI]], as was explained in the aforesaid, the Rising or 
Receiving of the Weight upon which marks the third Note of the 
first Measure, leaving the right Foot, as in the aforesaid, upon 
the Point[[See the second Figure in Plate IV]]. The Drawing or Bringing of the right Foot point[-]
ed, as it crosses behind the left[[See the second Figure in Plate XI]], is the third Step, and marks 
Time to the first Note of the second Measure; and the second Note 
is in the Sink upon the said right Foot, preparing for the fourth 
and last Step that is made, in rising and stepping _sideways_ from 
the said Sink upon the left Foot[[See in some Degree the first Figure in Plate VI]], to the third Note, concluding 
in the first Position[[See the first Figure in Plate I]] as at commencing.

The next Way of performing this Step only differs from the fore[-]
going, in that, instead of the right or beginning Foot's making 
the first Step _behind_, as in the last, it is here made _before_ See the Characters of this Step in the second Table of the Plate marked O, Number V]], from 
whence it is called _before_ and _behind_; and this crossing or stepping 
of the Foot _before_ renders the Step much more agreeable and ful[-]
ler of Variety than the aforesaid, arising by Reason of the 
Twists and Turns the Body naturally gives and receives in the 
Performance thereof.

But since this Step is much more used, in the _Dancing_ of a 
_Minuet_, than the aforesaid, I shall endeavour to give as plain a 
Description of it as possible; in order to which I shall not only re[-]
peat the Stepping or Motion of the Feet, but also suppose, instead 
of two Bars or Measures to a Step in the _Minuet_, as in the aforesaid, 
{112} only one Bar or Measure, which in Effect is the same Thing; for 
what matters it, whether we count three twice over, or six but 
once; or whether the half Time is beat to one, two, three, or to 
four, five, fix, which last Method, in my humble Opinion, I take 
to be much more familiar and easy to be comprehended than the 
other, in that there is not any Repetition of the first or second 
Measure; but, however that be, I am sure, it will afford a greater 
Variety, and possibly may inform some of what, perhaps, they 
were ignorant of before.

But to proceed in the Description of the Step now treated on: 
For Instance, the Weight and Position, as aforesaid[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], facing 
either to the upper or lower End of the Room, it begins in making 
a Sink and Step sideways, with the right Foot crossing directly be[-]
fore the left[[See the first Figure in Plate XI, Book I]] to the same Side of the Room, and producing a 
Twist or Turn of the Body towards the said Step[[See in some Measure the Twist or Turn of the Body in the said Figure]] which receives 
the Weight upon the Toe, marking Time to the first of the above[-]
mentioned Notes. The second is in the coming down of the right 
Heel, in the third Position before the left[[See the second Figure in Plate V, Book I]] and Sink for the suc[-]
ceeding Step, which is made by stepping the left Foot, open off 
sideways from the right on which the Body is, to the left Side of 
the Room[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, Book the same]]; the Rising or Receiving of the Body either upon the 
Toe or Heel marks the third Note, leaving the Toe of the right 
Foot upon the Point[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], in the same Place the Body was before 
the second Step was made. In the Stepping of the left Foot last 
mentioned it is to be observed, that the Body is convey'd or ra[-]
ther, more properly speaking, makes a becoming Feint in the Air 
not much unlike that made in the _Minuet_ Step of _One_, and a _Fleu[-]
ret_ to the right, only there the Bend or Sway the Body makes in 
the Air was to the right[[See in some Measure the Sway or Twist of the Body in the first Figure of Plate XI, Book I]] upon the _Half Coupee_, or first of the 
four Steps which compose the _Minuet Step_; but here it is upon the 
{113} second to the left, and the Look or Turn of the Head, which in 
the former was to the left, is in this to the right[[See also in some Degree the Twist or Sway of the Body in the second Figure of Plate XI, Book I]]: The Toe, I 
say, being left pointed, as aforesaid, makes the third Step in the 
_Minuet_, by being drawn pointed crossing behind the left Foot, 
and receives the Body in a Twist upon the fourth Note or half 
Time, as above[[See the second Figure in Plate XI, Book I]]. The fifth Note is in the Sink that prepares 
for the last Step of the four which compose the Step we now treat 
of, and is made in like Manner as the second Step with the left 
Foot to the third Note, in rising and stepping open off sideways[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate VI, Book aforesaid]] 
from the Sink aforesaid upon the left Toe to the sixth and last Note, 
except that the right Toe is not left pointed as in the former, but 
ends in the first Position as at Beginning[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]]; and the last Method 
of counting the Notes or Time to the Step will bear, as well 
throughout all the _Minuet Steps_ before described as the present.

Having explain'd the _Minuet Steps_ which form the Circle of this 
_Dance_, I shall next take Notice of some of the most remarkable 
Steps used, by Way of Embroidery or farther Grace thereto, as the 
_Hop_, _Double Bouree_, or _Fleuret_ advancing or in the same Place, 
_Balance_, _&c_.

### CHAP. II.

### _Of the HOP in the MINUET._

THE _Hop_ in the _Minuet_ needs little farther Explanation, since 
it has been already described in the _Rigadoon Hop_ of two 
Springs; I shall therefore refer to that, because it is the very 
same as the _Hop_ under Consideration, only, when performed in 
{114} a _Minuet_, there must be a _Bound_ added and a different Method in 
counting of the Notes; for, instead of performing the first and se[-]
cond Springs to one Bar or Measure, as in the aforesaid, they are 
divided, that is to say, the first _Spring_ or _Hop_ is to the first Bar of 
the _Minuet Tune_, and the next Spring and the Bound which is ad[-]
ded are to the second. They are all here to be reckoned but as one 
Step[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number I]], which is in its Performance thus: For Example, the Weight 
and Position being as aforesaid[[See the first Figure in Plate V, Book I]], the Spring is made in like Man[-]
ner upon the first Note; but, instead of the right or advanced 
Foot's being set down upon the second Note, it is now put down to 
the third[[See the second Figure in Plate IX, Book I]], the second being counted in the Progress the right 
Foot made in the Air, concluding one half of the _Hop_ in the Sink 
upon the aforesaid third Note, that prepares for the second Spring 
which is made, as in the aforesaid, to the fourth or beginning 
Note of the second Measure by taking of the left Foot up from the 
Floor into the third Position behind the right and advanced Foot 
upon which the Weight of the Body now is[[See the second Figure in Plate V, Book aforesaid]]. The left being upon 
the Point and at Liberty makes the _Bound_, as was shewn in treating 
of that Step, the Sink or Preparative for which marks the fifth 
Note; and the sixth is in the _Spring_ or _Bound_ upon the left Foot, 
by rising or springing off from the right on which the Weight rest[-]
ed before the said Spring was made, concluding as at first[[See the first Figure in Plate V. Book I]].

This _Hop_ in the _Minuet_ may be performed _backwards_, in the 
same Manner as described _forwards_, except that, instead of com[-]
mencing with the right Foot from the third Position behind, it 
must be from the same Position before[[See the second Figure in Plate IV, Book I]]; but the rest being intirely 
the same there needs nothing more to be said of it here, since 
it has been fully explained in the _Rigadoon Step_ of two Springs _for[-]
wards_, by which it may be easily understood how it is performed 
_backwards_[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number II]].

### {115} CHAP. III. 

### _Of the Double BOUREE upon the same Place._ 

THIS Step is taken from the third Position before and ends 
in the same behind, answering to two Measures of the 
Tune, the same as the _Minuet Step_, and is here esteemed but as 
one Step; tho' it is otherwise when it is performed in a _Saraband_, 
or such like slow Movement, for then one of them alone is to a 
Measure without any Dependence on the other, beginning 
with either the right or left Foot, as Occasion offers. But it is 
not so in the _Minuet_, for the first _Bouree_ or _Fleuret_ must com[-]
mence with the right Foot, as an Equivalent to the _Half Coupee_; 
and the second _Bouree_ to the remaining _Fleuret_ or second Part of 
the _Minuet Step_, as usual, with the left Foot, compleating six 
Steps in the same Space of Time as the foregoing _Minuet Step_ of 
four, and consequently much swifter in its Performance[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number III]], which 
is thus: The Weight of the Body being upon the left Foot in 
the third Position, the right inclosed before it and disengaged[[See the second Figure in Plate IV, Book I]] 
begins in making a _Sink_ or _Bend_ of both Knees, from 
whence the right in rising steps directly open off sideways, either 
more or less according to the Tune: For Example, if to the above[-]
said slow Time, it may then be the Length of a Step in Walking, 
or of a _Point_ in the _March_[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book aforesaid]]; but not so now, by Reason of the 
Quickness of the Tune. Therefore, about half the Length of the 
said Step, receiving the Weight of the Body upon the Instep 
or Toe of the right Foot to the first Note, the left on which the 
{116} Weight was remains in the same Place, only the Toe is pointed[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, Book I]]; 
the second Note is in the Raising of the said left Toe and setting 
down or receiving of the Weight upon the left Heel, and also leaving 
the right Foot upon the Point where it marked the first Note[[See the second Figure in Plate the aforesaid]]; 
from whence it is drawn swift into the third Position behind the left[[See the first Figure in Plate IV, Book I.]], 
at the same Time pressing to the Toe strong to the Floor, the recei[-]
ving of the Weight upon which is to the third Note, concluding the 
first _Bouree_ and Measure in a smooth easy Sink upon the right Foot, 
and bending the left the same Instant the right receives the Body 
in order to begin the second _Bouree_.

The second _Bouree_ is like the aforesaid, in rising from the Sink 
by stepping of the left Foot off sideways to the same Hand[[See in some Respects the first Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], re[-]
ceiving the Weight upon the Toe or Instep to the fourth Note and 
Beginning of the second Measure of the Tune, and leaving the right 
Toe upon the Point as aforesaid[[See the second Figure in the same Plate]]; the fifth is in the Raising the 
said Toe and setting down or receiving the Weight upon the right 
Heel, leaving the left Toe pointed, as in the first _Bouree_, or where 
it marked the fourth Note[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]]; from whence it is drawn swift into 
the third Position behind the right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate IV, Book I]], pressing the Toe 
strong to the Floor at the same Instant; the receiving of the Weight 
upon which is to the sixth Note, and concludes the second Mea[-]
sure of the Tune in the same Step of the _Dance_, in the Position as 
at commencing.

It must be observed, that if this Step is performed twice over, 
as in that under Consideration, the Sink falls upon the sixth Note 
of the second _Bouree_, the same as upon the third in the first.

Having described the foregoing Step _upon the same Place_, it 
may perhaps be acceptable to the Reader, if I add thereto the said 
_Bouree running_ or _flying_ along the Room[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number IV]], it being often used in 
{117} _Dancing_ of a _Minuet_ by those who have attained to such a Per[-]
fection in this Art, as to render them capable of judging the most 
proper Places of making use of it; and it only differs from the 
former by _advancing_, instead of being upon the same Spot of 
Ground.

The _running Bouree_ may be performed either from the Position 
treated on in the foregoing Step, or from the first as Occasion of[-]
fers; but I shall at present only explain it from the latter, that is 
to say, the first Position: The Weight being upon the left Foot, as 
in the aforesaid[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], it begins by making a Sink and Step with the 
right Foot forwards[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate IX, Book I]]. The Rise or Receiving of the Body upon 
the Toe marks the Time or first Note; the second Step, made with 
the left Foot[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]] plain upon the Toe, marks the same Note; 
and the third Step, with the right Foot[[See the second Figure in the same Plate]] plain in the like Manner 
upon the Toe, marks the third and last Note, concluding the first 
_Bouree_ in the same Position upon the right Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate I, Book I]], in a Readi[-]
ness to begin the second _Bouree_. The latter _Bouree_ commences by 
sinking upon the third Note and Step of the former, from whence 
it steps forwards, as the aforesaid[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate IX, Book I]], the Rise of which upon the 
left Toe is to the fourth Note; the second Step plain with the right 
Foot[[See the second Figure in the same Plate]] marks the fifth in the like Manner, and the third Step plain 
with the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate IX, as aforesaid]] the sixth; and it concludes in the first Positi[-]
on as at first[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], from whence it may be continued.

### {118} CHAP. IV. 

### _Of the BALANCE._

THE _Balance_ is compos'd of two plain Steps, to which are ad[-]
ded two Movements or Sinkings and Risings commencing 
from two different Positions, namely, the first and second Position 
or _Point_, as in the Beginning of a _March_; and the said Steps and 
Movements are equal in Value to one _Minuet Step_, and fill up two 
Measures of the Tune the same as in that[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number V]].

The _Balance_ is performed thus: For Instance, the Weight of 
the Body being in the first Position, as above, upon the left Foot[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], 
the right disengaged makes the first Movement and Step by 
sinking or Bending of the Knees, and stepping with the right Foot 
directly opening off sideways[[See in some Degree the second Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], facing either to the upper or low[-]
er Part of the Room, as it shall happen. The Rising or Receiving 
of the Weight upon the Toe or Heel marks Time to the first Note; 
and, if upon the Toe, the second is in the Coming down of the 
Heel[[See the first Figure in the same Plate]]; or, if made upon the Heel, it is in the tight Holding of 
the Knee after the Rise to the first Note is made, leaving the left 
Toe upon the Point[[See the same Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], on the very same Place the Body was at 
the Beginning of the Step[[See the second Figure in Plate VI]]. The third Note, which concludes 
the first Measure and Part of the Step, is in the Sink that prepares 
for the second Step of the _Balance_, namely, with the left Foot 
from the Point aforesaid, in which it touches the Heel of the right 
Foot[[See the second Figure in Plate I, Book I]] and then steps open off sideways[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], receiving the Weight 
{119} of the Body, either upon the Toe or Heel to the fourth Note, in 
the same Place from whence it was brought from the Point. The 
Coming down or Fall of the left Heel is to the fifth Note, if the 
Rise be made upon the Toe; if not, in the tight Holding of the 
Knee, as aforesaid, ending in the first Position, as at Beginning[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]]. 
The sixth Note is in the Sink or Preparation for the succeeding Step, 
whether it be the same or any other; and, when this Step is per[-]
formed with a quarter or half Turn, as it frequently is, it must al[-]
ways be turning to the left Hand, if commencing with the right 
Foot, as it does in the present.

### CHAP. V.

### _Of the two COULEES or MARCHES._

TO perform two _Marches_, instead of a _Minuet Step_, in a 
suitable and proper Place in _Dancing_ of a _Minuet_, I take to 
be an agreeable Variation or Change; but, as the Manner of per[-]
forming a _March_ has been already shewn, I shall refer to what has 
been before observed upon that Step, and only take Notice, that it 
must begin with the right Foot to the first Measure, and with the 
left to the second. The first of these is to be made upon One, 
Two, and Three; and the second upon Four, Five, and six, in the 
like Method as already explained in the Step of this Name[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number VI]].

### {120} CHAP. VI. 

### _Of the SLIP behind and HALF COUPEE 
    forwards to the right and left Hands, each to a MI
    NUET STEP._

THIS Step is composed of three plain Steps, as the _Bouree_, 
which are generally done to a Measure, as that, in other 
_Dances_; but otherwise here, in that it is equal in Value to a Step 
in the _Minuet_, and consequently, like that, takes up two Measures 
or Bars of the Tune[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number VII]]. It is performed facing either, up or down 
the Room, as in _Dancing_ of the _Minuet_ it shall fall out, but usu[-]
ally to our _Partner_, and may be taken from the third or first Po[-]
sition: For Instance, the Weight being upon the left Foot, with 
the right at Liberty resting upon the Heel of the said left Foot, 
as in the _March_[[See the first Figure in Plate V, Book I]]; or, if from the first, instead of behind, as we 
have observed, it is equal to the Foot on which the Body is, facing 
to the upper End of the Room, which shall here suffice as an Ex[-]
ample[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], and begins the _Slip_, or first and second Steps of the three 
that compose this Step, by making a Sink and Step sideways open 
off to the right Side of the Room[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book I]], rising upon the Toe or Heel 
to the first Note, and leaving the left Foot on which the Weight 
was[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]] upon the _Point_ in the same Place[[See the first Figure in Plate VI, Book I]]. It rests there, during 
the counting the second Note; and the third is in the swift Draw[-]
ing of the said left Foot pointed cross behind the right[[See the first Figure in Plate XI, Book I]], conclu[-]
ding the second Step of the three to the first Measure, in receiving 
{121} the Body in an agreeable Twist or Turn[[See the Contrast or Sway in the first Figure of Plate XI, Book I]] with both Knees bent; 
that is to say, in the crossing, as aforesaid, the left Shoulder, in 
bringing forward before the right, is more raised by the lowering 
or falling of the other.

The first Movement being thus ended, with the Knees bent up[-]
on the third Note, in Order to the Performance of the _Coupee_, or 
second Part of this Step, which is made to the second Measure by 
rising from the Sink aforesaid and stepping of the right Foot for[-]
wards[[See in some Measure the second Figure in Plate IX, Book I]], the Rising or Receiving of the Body on the Toe or Heel 
marks the fourth or beginning Note of the second Measure; 
and the fifth is in the Coming down of the said Heel 
to the Floor, if the Rise was upon the Instep in the first[[See the second Figure in Plate I, Book aforesaid]] or third 
Position[[See the second Figure in Plate V, Book I]], with the left Foot at Liberty the same as the right at 
commencing. The sixth Note is in the Sink which prepares for the 
same Step with the other Foot; and you are likewise to observe 
that, in the Performance of the _Half Coupee_ or second Part of the 
foregoing Step, the Body returns from the said Twist in bringing 
the right Shoulder, which was behind and somewhat inclined 
downwards, to be equally forwards to the left and the same in Height: 
For Example, when we stand in a natural and erect Posture.

But to return to the _Slip_ to the left Hand, which is the very same 
as to the right already explained, it begins in rising from the Sink 
aforesaid, stepping open off sideways to the left Hand[[See in some Measure the first Figure in Plate VI, Book I]]; and 
the rising upon the Toe or Heel of the left Foot marks the first 
Note, leaving the right Toe upon the Point[[See the second Figure in the same Plate]], as the foregoing 
did the left, making a Pause or Rest whilst the second Note is count[-]
ed. The third Note is in the drawing or crossing of the right 
Foot behind the left[[See the second Figure in Plate XI, Book I]], receiving the Body in the aforesaid Twist[[See the Sway or Twist in the second Figure of Plate XI, aforesaid]] 
and bending of both the Knees, in which the right Shoulder is 
{122} raised in advancing, as in the foregoing, to the right Hand the left 
Shoulder[[See the first Figure in the Plate XI, Book I]] was on concluding one half of the Step to the first Mea[-]
sure of the two; and the second is in the _Half Coupee_ that is made 
as in the aforesaid, by rising from the Sink which fell upon the 
third Note and stepping of the left Foot forwards[[See the first Figure in Plate IX, Book I]]. The Rise 
Receiving of the Weight upon the Toe is to the fourth Note of the 
next Measure; the fifth is in the Falling of the Heel[[See the first Figure in Plate I, Book I]], and the 
sixth in the Sink for the succeeding Step, concluding upon the left 
Foot, as at beginning, in one of the said Positions[[See the first Figure in Plate I, or first Figure of Plate V, Book I]].

Having now shewn the Method of performing this Step in _Dan[-]
cing_ of a _Minuet_, both to the right and left Hands (as indeed it can[-]
not be done to one without the other by Reason they both change 
the Feet but as one _Minuet Step_, two _Bourees_, or two _Marches_) 
since this Step is much used in Tunes of common and triple Time, 
as _Rigadoons_, _Bourees_, _Sarabands_, and _Passacailles_, _&c_. and also, 
instead of being performed to two Measures, as in this Dance, is of[-]
ten found to one Bar only[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number VIII]] and of Consequence varies in the Me[-]
thod of counting from the aforesaid, it will not be improper to say 
something of it here, especially as it has hitherto been omitted: 
For Example, in _Bourees_ and _Rigadoons_ the Rise of the first Move[-]
ment marks Time to the first Note, as in the foregoing; but the 
second differs in this that, instead of the Toe's being pointed dur[-]
ing the counting of the second Note, it is drawn swift behind the 
Foot on which the Weight is full upon the said Note, receiving the 
Body in the Twist[[See the first and second Figures in Plate XI, Book I]] and Bending of the Knees, as aforesaid. The 
Rise of the _Half Coupee_, which in the foregoing was to the second 
Measure, is now to the third Note, and the fourth Note falls in the 
Sink for the succeeding Step; or if done to two Measures here, as 
in the _Minuet_, then, instead of counting only upon the Point, 
the second Note before its drawing behind the third must also be 
{123} reckoned, immediately upon which the _Slip_ is made, as in the 
foregoing, to the fourth and last Note. The Rise to the _Half 
Coupee_ marks Time to the first Note of the second Measure; the 
second is in the Fall of the Heel, the third in the Rest the Body 
makes upon it, and the fourth in the Sink for the succeeding 
Step.

But if to the above Tunes of triple Time it be performed to two 
Bars, it is much the same, as in the _Minuet_, only more solemn 
and grave, and the Foot that is upon the Point follows the Rise in 
a slow Progress, pressing the Floor upon the second Note and Be[-]
ginning of the third; but before the Expiration thereof it is brought 
swift behind the Foot on which the Weight is, concluding the first 
Measure as in the _Minuet_; and the _Half Coupee_ is to the second 
Measure the same only, as I have said, more grave and slow.

When this Step is performed to one Measure, as in the afore[-]
said Tunes of triple Time, the easy Rise from the first Step made 
open off sideways is upon the first Note; and the Point or second 
Step attends the said Rise in a slow Progress, during the counting of 
the second Note, and then is drawn swift behind, before the Expi[-]
ring of the said Note in a full Sink or Bending of the Knees; and 
the third is in the Rise of the _Half Coupee_ made from thence by 
stepping forwards, as aforesaid, half of which is borrowed in the 
Sink for the next Step in the Movements last mentioned. This 
Step is sometimes done to both Hands, as in the _Minuet_; but it is 
often found single.

### _Of DANCING the MINUET in general._

HAving explained the different Ways in which the Steps of a 
_Minuet_ are to be perform'd, I shall now say something of 
that _Dance_ in general and proceed to shew, how the said Steps 
form the Circle or Figure thereof by linking them one to another 
in Order as they fall; and in the first Place observe, that the 
_Minuet_ now in Use is compos'd of three different Steps that form 
the Figure of it, which is mostly circular or in the Shape of an S 
reversed or an Z[[See the second and fifth Divisions of the Plate marked U]], upon which said S or Z the abovenamed 
Steps present themselves, as follows: That is to say, after making 
our Honour or Courtesy to the Presence[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate II]] or upper Part of the 
Room in which we _dance_, and afterwards to our _Partner_[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate IV]], the 
_Dance_ begins directly. Instead of stepping back again into your 
Place, as the Custom was formerly, and also instead of standing to 
wait the Close or Ending of a Strain of the Tune, begin upon the 
first Time that offers, in that it is much more genteel and shews 
the _Dancer_'s Capacity and Ear in distinguishing of the Time, and 
from thence begets himself a good Opinion from the Beholders, 
who are apt to judge favourably of the following Part of his Per[-]
formance; whereas the attending the concluding or finishing of 
a Strain has the contrary Effect.

However the latter is by much the safer Way for those whose 
Ear is not very good, the concluding of a Strain of the Tune be[-]
ing much more remarkable than the middle Part; for, if they 
should happen to begin out of Time, it is a thousand to one if they 
{125} recover it throughout the _Dance_. But on the other Hand, had 
they waited a remarkable Place of the Tune, and taken the Time 
at Beginning, they might have come off with Reputation and Ap[-]
plause; for many _dance_ the _Minuet Step_ in true and regular Time, 
tho' out of Time to the _Music_, which is Occasioned by not hitting 
with it right at first; and not being able to recover it afterwards, 
they _dance_ the whole _Minuet_ out of Time. Their _dancing_ on this 
Account loses its Effect upon the Beholders; for, if the Steps and 
the Notes do not perfectly agree, in their performing, one with 
another, they can produce no Harmony, and if no Harmony, no 
Pleasure to those they design to entertain.

But to the Step and Figure, as aforesaid, the Honour or Cour[-]
tesy being made as above, the _Lady_ faces the _Gentleman_, who, just 
before the _Dance_ commences, presents his right Hand, or makes a 
Motion as tho' he would if he was not at too far a Distance, and be[-]
gins the _Dance_ in making the _Half Coupee_ and _Fleuret_ (and rest of 
the Steps leading to what I call the _Introduction_) open off sideways 
to the right Hand in the Manner already described, facing the _La[-]
dy_ or right Side of the Room, who performs the same to the left[[See the Characters or Steps marked I in Plate IV, or first Division of this Dance in the Plate distinguished by the Letter U, Book II]]; 
and in the following Step they return again in two _Minuet 
Steps_ of three Movements to the left, all behind, the last of which 
ends to the upper Part of the Room[[See in Plate IV, or first Division of the Plate distinguished by the Letter U, the Steps or Characters marked 2, and 3]] to which both advance in 
_One_ and a _Fleuret_[[See the Characters or Steps marked 4 in Plate IV. or first Division of the Plate marked U]]. About this Time the _Gentleman_ presents his 
right Hand to the _Lady_[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate V]] and performs four more of the said Steps[[See the Characters or Steps marked with the Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, in Plate V, or in the first Division of the Plate marked U on the _Man_'s Side]]; 
the first whereof is either advancing, as the foregoing, or side[-]
ways open off to the right Hand facing the Presence or upper End, 
as aforesaid, the rest turning gradually the same Way, 'till he arrives 
at the left upper Corner of the Room facing the Bottom thereof[[See the _Gentleman_ or first Figure in Plate VI]]. 
During this he hands or introduces the _Lady_ into the _Dance_ in the 
{126} most agreeable Manner he possibly can, by leading or conducting 
her in the Circle round him in her Performance of the like Number of 
Steps[[See the Steps upon the _Lady_'s Tract marked 5, 6, 7, 8, in Plate V, or in the first Division of the Characters or Steps contained in the Plate marked U]], that is to say, of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ forwards; and, about 
the End of the second or third Step after giving Hands, he breaks 
off or lets go the[[See the Characters or Steps marked 6 and 7 in Plate V, and first Division in Plate marked U]] _Lady_ who continues on a Step more to the 
lower right Corner of the Room, and then makes a _Half Coupee_ 
and _Bouree_ to the same Hand sideways to the upper End of it[[See the Character or Step marked 8 in Plate V, and Division aforesaid]], 
provided the Break or Letting go of the Hands was upon the second 
Step[[See the Character or Step marked 6 upon the _Lady_'s Tract or Figure in Plate V]], as I have observed; but, if on the third[[See the Character or Step marked 7 in Plate V]], the _Half 
Coupee_ and _Bouree_ or fourth of the Steps aforesaid is made directly fa[-]
cing the upper Part of the Room[[See the Step marked 8]], as I have said[[See the _Lady_ in Plate VI]], concluding 
the first Division or Part of the _Minuet Dance_ in the Hat's being put on 
in a graceful Manner.

There is no general Rule in the Performance of this _Dance_, as 
to its Length or Shortness; however I shall reduce and divide it into 
six Parts or Divisions[[See the whole Dance included in the Plate marked U]], by Way of Distinction one from another, 
each consisting of eight _Minuet Steps_, which to a _Minuet_ Tune 
of the like Numbers of Bars will answer the first Strain played 
twice over[[See the Music contain'd in the fourth and fifth Plates or first Division in the Plate marked U]].

### CHAP. VII.

### _Of the Figure of S Reversed or second Division._ 

HAving explained the Introduction or first Part of this _Dance_, 
I shall now proceed to the second; which in Figure is circu[-]
lar {127} or, as I have said, in the Form of an S reversed, or Z, upon 
which fall the Steps that adorn this Part of the _Dance_, and are per[-]
formed as follows: For Instance, the _Gentleman_ at the upper left 
Corner of the Room faces the _Lady_ who is at the lower right in the 
third Position, where the foregoing ended with the right Foot dis[-]
engaged and inclosed before the left[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VI]], and they commence in per[-]
forming about four of the _Minuet Steps_ of three Movements before 
and behind sideways crossing the Room to the left Hand; that is to 
say, the _Gentleman_ performs to the right Side of the Room and the 
_Lady_ to the left[[See the Characters or Steps marked 1, 2, 3, 4, in Plate VI]], who by turning a small Matter gradually upon 
the third and fourth of the said Steps meet in the Middle of the 
Room facing one another[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VII]], and pass obliquely upon the right 
Hand of each other; that is, the _Lady_ to the uppermost right Cor[-]
ner, and the _Gentleman_ to the lower left[[See the Tract or Figure in Plate VII, or second Division in Plate U]], continuing on the re[-]
maining half Circle or Figure in four _Minuet Steps_ of _One_ and a 
_Fleuret_ forwards[[See the Characters or Steps marked 5, 6, 7, 8, in Plate VII, or second Division of the Plate marked U]]. The _Lady_, as I have said, passes on round 
by the right upper Corner 'till the arrives at the left, looking full 
to the Bottom of the Room[[See the _Lady_ in Plate VIII]]. 

The last of the foresaid Steps[[See the Character or Step in Plate XIII, marked 8]] may also be made open off side[-]
ways to the right Hand, turning a quarter of a Turn the same Way; 
that is, the _Lady_ from facing the left Side of the Room[[See the _Lady_ and _Gentleman_ in Plate XIII]] turns 
down it, concluding in the third Position as above. The _Gentle[-]
man_ does the same, passing by the lower left Side in his Way to 
the right, and concludes as aforesaid, only up the Room[[See the _Gentleman_ in Plates VII and XIII]].

But, instead of either of the former Ways, this Part of the _Dance_ 
is frequently performed in making the first of the four Steps for[-]
wards, after passing each other, and then not continuing the remain[-]
ing Circle on forwards, or to the last _One_ and a _Fleuret_ open off 
to the right Hand sideways, as before; but instead thereof three 
{128} of the said _Minuet Steps_ are made directly opening off sideways to 
the right Hand, by making half a Turn upon the _Half Coupee_, or 
Beginning of the first of them, from the upper End of the Room, 
the rest continuing on to the upper left Side facing the lower End. 
The _Gentleman_ performs the same Way except that, after the half 
Turn from the Bottom, he makes the said three Steps to the lower 
right Side of the Room facing the _Lady_, or up it, answering the 
playing of the second Strain of the Tune twice over,[[See the Music contained in Plates VI and VII, or second Division in the Plate marked U]], which now 
has been played once through, and concludes the second Division of 
the _Dance_; and it is likewise to be observed that, in the Performance 
of these eight Minuet Steps, the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ only alternate[-]
ly change Places[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VIII]].

### CHAP. VIII.

### _Upon PRESENTING the right Arm or third 
    Part._

THE second foregoing Step being explained we enter upon the 
third, which consists in the Ceremony of _presenting_ or giving 
the right Hand; and in it there is no small Beauty and Air, as to 
the graceful and easy raising of it, in Order to take Hands, and 
also the gentle and natural Fall on Letting them go. As for the 
Tract or Figure it varies from the former, in its being circular 
but particularly towards the latter End, upon which Tract the Steps 
we now treat of are to be performed, as follows: For Example, 
the _Gentleman_ at the lower Part of the Room on the right Side, and 
the _Lady_ at the upper left Side, facing each other[[See the Plate aforesaid]], begin the first 
{129} Step either obliquely open off sideways to the right Hand, or else 
instead thereof make four _Minuet Steps_ of three Movements before 
and behind crossing the Room to the left Hand; that is to say, 
the _Gentleman_ to the left Side of the Room and the _Lady_ to the 
right[[See the Characters or Steps marked 1, 2, 3, 4, in Plate VIII, or third Division of Plate U]], turning a little upon the third and fourth _Minuet Steps_, 
so as to face each other near the Middle of the Room[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate XI]]. Instead 
of passing forwards to the cross Corners, as in the second Division, 
they turn a quarter off to the upper and lower Ends of the Room 
upon the last Movement of the fourth _Minuet Step_: For Instance, 
the _Gentleman_ to the Presence or upper Part, and the _Lady_ to the 
lower[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate IX]], to which each advance pursuing their respective Tracts in 
taking as large a Circumference, as the joining of Hands will ad[-]
mit.

In performing the four remaining _Minuet Steps_ forwards[[See the Characters or Steps in the said Plate IX marked 5, 6, 7, 8, or third Division of Plate U]], 
which are of _One_ and a _Fleuret_, the right Arm is to be raised in the 
Manner before observed, about the turning off or ending of the 
fourth _Minuet Step_ of three Movements[[See the last Step in Plate VIII, marked 4, and first of Plate IX]], as a Sign or Warning 
to the _Lady_ of the _Gentleman's presenting_ his Hand, which is given 
by an easy Bending of the Elbow before it is presented near the 
End of the fifth _Minuet Step_, continuing on round the sixth and 
seventh _Minuet Steps_ until the _Gentleman_ faces the upper right 
Corner of the Room and the _Lady_ the lower left. About this 
Time the Hands are let go and the Arm falls gently to the Side, 
whilst the eighth Step is perform'd obliquely off sideways to the right 
Hand[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VIII]] and lower right Corner of the Room, the _Gentleman_'s 
Head being a little turn'd looking upon the _Lady_ who does the 
like to the upper left Corner, concluding in the third Position as at 
commencing this Division, only much nigher to each other, and the 
Shoulders pointing to the upper and lower right and left Corners of 
the Room, as was already shewn in the Explanation of this Step; 
{130} which Part or Division of the _Dance_, as here treated on, falls 
upon the first Strain of the Tune, the second Time of playing, 
and answers to the Strain twice over[[See the Music to the Steps in Plates VIII and IX]].

As for the Taking off or Keeping on the Hat I shall not take upon 
me to determine, leaving it to every one's Choice to act as they 
shall think most agreeable, since it intirely depends upon Fashion 
and Fancy; but, as I have a Right as well as others humbly to of[-]
fer my Thoughts on this Point, I shall declare in Favour of the for[-]
mer, in that it has the Appearance of much more Complaisance 
and Air than Keeping the Hat upon the Head, which in my hum[-]
ble Opinion seems more flat and disrespectful; and the Taking off and 
Putting on of the Hat with a good Air likewise gives a singular 
Grace to the _Dance_, which is all lost by its remaining upon the 
Head.

But if it should be objected, that it is inconvenient and trouble[-]
some to take off the Hat with the right Hand, by Reason it must 
be changed to the left before the right can be at Liberty to present 
to the _Lady: I answer_, it is easy to be done; or it may be taken 
off with the left Hand as well as the right, and then once changing 
will serve, which may be upon the letting go or breaking off Hands, 
that is to say, in making _One_ and a _Fleuret_ open off to the right 
Hand. The said Step finishes the Part of the _Dance_ now treated 
of; and the Hat is to be taken off with the left Hand on giving the right 
falling naturally and slow down to the Side, and holding the Hat at 
Arms Length during the Time of changing, as was above observed.

### {131} CHAP. IX. 

### _Of the FOURTH DIVISION or PRE[-]
    SENTING of the left ARM._ 

AS the last explained treated of the presenting or giving the 
_right Hand_, the present or _fourth Division_ is upon _presenting_ 
of the left, which in its Performance is thus: For Instance, being 
upon the left of each other, the Hat in the right Hand, the Posi[-]
tion and Presence of the Body the same as at the Beginning of the 
third Part, only, as I have said on the Conclusion thereof, some[-]
thing nighr[[опечатка]] together, and the Body a little more turned to the 
right, the _Gentleman_ who faces the upper Part will be to the same 
Side of the Room, but the _Lady_, as the faces the lower Part, is 
to the left[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in the Plates VIII and X]]; to both of which each advance in eight _Minuet Steps_, 
returning upon the same Circle or Tract that conducted them hi[-]
ther, which is enlarged by the aforesaid turning[[See the Steps in Plate X, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or the fourth Division of Plate U]] and making 
the first _Minuet Step_ which is of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ forwards; and 
on the commencing thereof the left Arm is raised[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate X]] in a slow and 
easy Motion, in Order to be _presented_ or given, which is much 
upon the second _Minuet Step_ by a gentle bending of the Elbow, 
as in the aforesaid. 

But, instead of the second's being a _Minuet Step_ of _One_ and a 
_Fleuret_, you may make the _Minuet Hop_, which, if well executed, 
is an agreeable Variation proceeding round in the Continuation of 
three _Minuet Steps_ more of _One_ and a _Fleuret_, at the full Extent or 
Length of the Arms, 'till arrived very near the Place of setting out, 
{132} that is to say, whilst the _Gentleman_ faces to the upper right Corner 
of the Room and the _Lady_ the lower left[[See the Steps marked 3, 4, 5, on the different Tracts in Plate X, or in the fourth Division of Plate U]]; upon which Hands 
are broke off or let go, and, extended as they are, gently fall to 
their proper Places. The Hat is put on again with the right Hand, 
upon the Ceremony of the Arms being ended; and the three re[-]
maining _Minuet Steps_ are performed obliquely open off to the right 
Hand sideways[[See the Characters or Steps marked 6, 7, 8, in Plate X, or fourth Division of Plate U]], as upon the last Step of the preceding Divisi[-]
on[[See the Action of the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VIII]], or directly across the Room to the right and left Sides, con[-]
cluding in the Position and Place from whence the third Division 
of three Movements to the left begun; or, instead of the eighth and 
last's being made, as I just observed the _Double Bouree_ was perform[-]
ed, it would fall very naturally here and be no small Embellish[-]
ment to this Part of the _Dance_, or any other Steps to fill up the Time[[See the Characters of this Step in the third Table of the Plate marked O, Number 3]]. 
I mean when performed by such as have arrived at a Capaci[-]
ty of doing it perfectly, otherwise it is better omitted; but nothing 
can be more graceful than the former, as appears from what has 
been said in the Explanation of that Step; and it affords a far[-]
ther Variety, in that the Tune has now been twice played through 
on the Conclusion of the Division or Part now treated of[[See the Music to the first, second, third, and fourth Divisions in Plate U]], which 
was to the second Strain both Times over[[See the Music to the Part of the Dance contained in Plate X]].

### {133} CHAP. X. 

### _Of the fifth DIVISION or second S._

AS this Part of the _Dance_ has been already explained by the 
second _Division_, which in Figure and Step is altogether the 
same, except that, instead of the _Gentleman_'s being at the upper End 
of the Room as in the foregoing Part, the _Lady_ is now there and 
the _Gentleman_ at the lower[[See Plate VIII]], from whence both commence as in 
the aforesaid, I might here refer to what I formerly said, in that 
a farther Explanation seems entirely[[во всем тексте это слово Томлинсон пишет с ошибкой, но здесь - верно]] needless, since it will easily be 
comprehended from the former as some may imagine, it being no 
more than to perform the said Steps in the Method above described; 
yet, for the better understanding thereof, if I accompany the 
_Dancer_ or _Reader_ through this Part of the _Dance_ a second Time, 
it will not I hope be thought a tedious or unnecessary Repetition. 
The _Gentleman_ and _Lady_, situated as was already observed, both 
commence in performing the said four _Minuet Steps_ of three Move[-]
ments before and behind sideways crossing the Room to the left 
Hand; but the Gentleman now, instead of moving to the right 
Side of the Room, as in the second Division, moves to the left, 
the Lady doing the same to the right[[See the Characters or Steps mark'd 1, 2, 3, 4, in the said Plate VIII, or fifth Division in Plate U]]; and as I have said, by 
turning a small Matter gradually upon the third and fourth of the 
said Minuet Steps, they meet in the Middle of the Room, as in the 
aforesaid, facing one another[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate XI]] and pass obliquely upon the right 
Hand of each other, _viz_. the _Gentleman_ to the upper right Corner 
and the _Lady_ to the lower left, continuing on the remaining half 
Circle or Figure in four _Minuet Steps_ of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ as afore[-]
said {134} forwards[[See the Characters or Steps mark'd 5, 6, 7, and 8, in Plate XI, or the fifth Division of Plate U]], the _Gentleman_, as I have said, passing on round 
by the right upper Corner until arrived at the left facing down 
the Room[[See Plate VI]]. 

The last of the said four Steps may also be made open off side[-]
ways to the right Hand, turning a quarter of a Turn the same 
Way as the _Gentleman_ from facing the left Side of the Room[[See the Action in Plate XIV, and also the Character or Step marked 8]] 
down it, and finishing in the third Position[[See in some Measure Plate VI]]; and the _Lady_ the 
like, passing by the lower left in her Way to the right Side and 
concluding, as aforesaid, only up the Room[[See the aforesaid Plates IV, and XIV]]. 

But, instead of either of the foregoing Ways, this Part of the 
_Dance_ is usually perform'd in making the first of the four Steps 
forwards after Passing each other[[See the Character or Step in Plate XIV, marked 5]], and then not continuing the 
remaining on a Circle forwards, or to the last _One_ and a _Fleuret_ o[-]
pen off to the right Hand sideways, as before[[See the Steps or Characters in Plates XIII or XIV, mark'd 6, 7, and 8]], but instead 
thereof three of the said _Minuet Steps_ are performed directly open[-]
ing off sideways to the right Hand in making half a Turn upon the 
_Half Coupee_, or Beginning of the first of them, from the upper 
End of the Room, the remaining continuing on to the upper 
left Side facing the lower End. The _Lady_ does the same, except 
that after the half Turn from the Bottom the performs the said three 
Steps to the lower right Side of the Room, looking up it or to the 
_Gentleman_; and, having again alternately changed Places as before, 
the _Gentleman_ is left at the upper left Corner or Side of the Room 
and the _Lady_ at the lower right[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VI]], concluding to the first Strain 
of the Tune twice over which is now begun a third Time.[[See the fifth Division of Plate U. or the under written Music to Plates VIII, and XI]]

### {135} CHAP. XI. 

### _Of the sixth DIVISION or PRESENTING 
    of both ARMS and Conclusion._

THE sixth and concluding Part of the _Minuet Dance_ princi[-]
pally consists in the Ceremony of _presenting_ or giving _both 
Hands_, as the third and fourth Parts did in giving the _single Arm_, 
and they are much alike in Figure and Form: For Instance, the 
_Gentleman_ and _Lady_ facing each other in the third Position, where 
we left them in the three last explained[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VI pursuing their different Tracts or Figures to the Steps marked 1, 2, 3, and 4]] _Minuet Steps_, begin in 
the Performance of the like Number of Movements sideways each 
to the left Hand, the _Gentleman_ to the right Side of the Room 
and the _Lady_ to the left,; and, near the End or Finishing 
of the said three _Minuet Steps_, both turn off to the same Hand to 
which they were performed[[See the Character or Step in the sixth Division of Plate U marked 3]], as in the fourth _Minuet Step_ of three 
Movements belonging to the third Division, opening gracefully in 
Order to enlarge the Figure and _present both Hands_[[See more particularly the Steps marked 1, 2, 3, and 4, in the sixth Division of Plate U]] as the other 
was for _One_, only making the fourth _Minuet Step_ which is of _One_ 
and a _Fleuret_ forwards to that Part of the Room to which the Pre[-]
sence of the Body is directed; that is to say, the _Gentleman_ to 
the _lower_ and the _Lady_ to the _upper_[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate XII]], upon the Beginning of 
which said Step both Arms are raised in the easy Gracefulness obser[-]
ved in the single Arm, as the Sign or Warning of giving both Hands,[[See the Action in the Figures of Plate XII]] 
which is done upon the commencing of the fifth or succeed[-]
ing Step.

{136} In this Part of the _Dance_ there may be a _Minuet Hop_, instead of 
_One_ and a _Fleuret_, continuing on round upon the right Side of each 
other, until the _Gentleman_ faces the upper Part of the Room and 
the _Lady_ the lower[[See in some Measure the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate IX]], which will be about the Conclusion of 
the sixth _Minuet Step_; during which the Arms are raised near the 
Height of the Shoulder, and the Elbows a little elevated or raised 
forming a Circle or whole Round. 

In this Posture the seventh and eighth _Minuet Steps_ are also per[-]
formed, the _Gentleman_ making _One_ and a _Fleuret_ backwards, or 
rather a small Matter to the right, whilst the _Lady_ performs the 
same Steps forwards[[See the Steps marked 5, 6, 7, and 8, in Plate XII, or Steps with the same Figures in the sixth Division of Plate U]], upon which the Hands are let go; and the 
_Gentleman_, in making the Slip or Beginning of the eighth _Minuet 
Step_, takes off his Hat with the right Hand which falls gently down 
to the Side, as aforesaid, in Order to make the Reverence or Bow 
to the Presence or upper End of the Room, which is upon the 
third and fourth _Minuet Step_. At the same Instant the _Lady_ cou[-]
pees to the _Gentleman_ in a half Turn to the right from the lower 
Part of the Room facing up it, and leaves the right Foot upon the 
Point[[See the second Figure in Plate VI, Book I]] finishing the remaining half of the Step and _Dance_ in the 
Reverence or Courtesy made in drawing the said right Foot behind 
the left, on which the Body rests, into the third or fifth Position[[See the first Figure in Plate IV, or second of Plate XI, Book I]]; 
after which the Honour or Respect is made to each other and the 
Ceremony ended[[See the second, third, and fourth Plates]], as also the Tune which has now been play[-]
ed three Times over[[See the Music to the Steps of Plates VI and XII, or last Division of Plate U]]. 

As to the Hat I should rather approve of its not being taken off 
here 'till the breaking off or letting go of both Hands; however this 
is likewise submitted to the _Dancer_'s Choice, as well as the Pre[-]
senting of the single Arm, whether he takes it off, or keeps it on, 
throughout the whole _Dance_.

### {137} CHAP. XII. 

### _Of the MISTAKES in DANCING of a 
    MINUET, with their OCCASIONS and 
    RULES to prevent them._

IN the foregoing Chapters I have shewn the Method or Manner 
in which the _Minuet Dance_ is to be performed, when reduced 
to a just and regular _Dance_; yet in Effect it is no more than a 
voluntary or extemporary Piece of Performance, as has already been 
hinted, in Regard there is no limited Rule, as to its Length or Short[-]
ness, or in Relation to the Time of the Tune, since it may begin upon 
any that offers, as well within a Strain as upon the first Note or 
commencing thereof. It is the very same with Respect to its end[-]
ing, for it matters not whether it breaks off upon the End of the 
first Strain of the Tune, the second, or in the Middle of either of 
them, provided it be in Time to the _Music_; but nevertheless there 
are frequently _Mistakes_, in the Performance of this _Dance_, arising 
from Want of a just Notion of the Figure and some certain Rule 
in performing the Steps upon the said Figure, and more particu[-]
larly those Steps which are designed by Way of Ornament or far[-]
ther Grace, which instead of that often prove its Disgrace. No[-]
thing is more common than to see the _Gentleman_ or _Lady_ de[-]
tained in the Performance of some Step, in Order to illustrate the 
_Dance_; and so consequently not reaching that Part of the Room, 
on which the crossing is made, Time enough[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plates VII, and XI]], instead of per[-]
forming _One_ and a _Fleuret_ open off sideways to the right Hand[[See the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plates VI, and VIII]], 
{138} or some such like Step, or making a Feint off to the right Hand 
in the same _Minuet Step_ quite round forwards falling into the _Mi[-]
nuet Step_ of three Movements all behind facing the right or left 
Side, as it shall fall out, by which Time the former will be arrived at 
the Place of crossing which will then be in its due Time; where[-]
as the running in either before or behind our _Partner_, as before, 
would have caused a Confusion. 

This Disorder also frequently happens in performing the com[-]
mon _Minuet Step_, as when one of the _Dancers_ does not fill out the 
Room and Figure in the Performance of an equal Number of Steps 
to the other; for, if this be not observed, it will produce the like Ef[-]
fect as the former; or if, as I have observed,in presenting the right 
Hand or giving of both, a sufficient Warning is not had by rai[-]
sing of the Hand or Hands, as aforesaid, one _Minuet Step_ before 
the Hands are given[[See the Divisions or Chapters which treat of giving the Hands]], the _Dancers_ are often nonplus'd and put 
out of the Figure, while on the contrary a Presence of Mind with 
the Observation of these _Rules_ will prevent all such Blunders and 
Confusions. 

There is yet one Observation more, with which I shall conclude 
what I have to say upon this Head, which may be of some Service 
in preventing the said Accidents, _viz_. The marking whether the 
_Minuet Step_ of three Movements before and behind sideways to 
the left Hand, which introduces or leads to the giving the right 
Hand, was facing up or down the Room, because in going the 
Circle or Figure round to the right you certainly come to the same 
Place[[See For Example the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate VIII]], whether it be facing to the upper or lower Part of the 
Room, ending the Division in the _Minuet Step_ of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ 
obliquely off sideways to the right Hand and looking the same Way 
as described in that Step; and also the like in the Performance of 
the _Minuet Steps_ round to the left, in which the said Hand is 
given[[See the Beginning in the _Gentleman_ and _Lady_ in Plate X, concluding in Plate VIII]]. 

{139} As the foregoing are the principal Places, in which young _Dan[-]
cers_ usually Mistake, I thought the making some Observations on 
the _Occasion_, and the _Rules_ or _Methods_ to be observed in prevent[-]
ing them, might not be unacceptable; for, admitting that _Masters_ 
may have frequently taught their Scholars the same Lesson, yet 
according to the old Saying, _Words soon pass into Oblivion, but what 
is put down in Print remains more strongly fix'd upon the Mind_. 

There is much more that might be said upon this Subject; but, 
as the aforesaid is sufficient, to avoid being tedious I shall only 
proceed to the making a few farther Observations, in Regard to 
the foregoing described Steps, which as yet have not been introdu[-]
ced into the _Dance_ above explained nor any Place assigned them 
therein: For Instance, the _March, Balance, Slip_ behind and 
Step forwards being to the right Hand, and the same to the left 
and a _Double Bouree_ forwards, every one of which Steps, as was 
already observed, depend upon Fancy, as there are some Parts 
of the _Dance_ much more proper than others, it may not be 
foreign to my present Purpose to take Notice of them; and in the 
first Place introduce the _March_, which seems to claim three Places 
in the said _Dance_, the Choice of which rests in the Performer, for 
it is to be observed that no Step of this Sort is ever performed 
more than once or twice in _Dancing_ of a _Minuet_. For Example, 
should the said Dance be perform'd in one Assembly or Compa[-]
ny twice or thrice over, its Steps ought to be varied as much as possi[-]
ble, that is, provided the _Dancer_ is capable thereof; otherwise, as I 
have already observed, it is much better performed plain; but to 
what I was saying the two _Marches_ will be agreeably made advan[-]
cing upon the seventh _Minuet Step_ of the second Division, the first 
of the three Ways there described, that is, of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ 
continuing all round forwards. 

The eighth _Minuet Step_ may be of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ open off 
sideways to the right Hand, as aforesaid, facing either to the up[-]
per or lower End of the Room, as it happens; the next Place it 
challenges is the second Measure of the fourth Division, instead of 
the _Hop_ which is then left out; and the third is upon the last Step 
{140} but one of the fifth Division or second S, intirely in the same Method 
described in the second Division. 

The _Balance_ is also frequently made much about the same Place 
or eighth _Minuet Step_, either sideways facing each other, or advan[-]
cing and retiring; and the next is the _Slip behind_ and Step forwards 
to the right and left Hands, each to a _Minuet Step_ and Fall in their 
Performance upon the aforesaid second and fifth Divisions, only 
in the second of the three Methods explained in the second Part of 
the _Dance_, by breaking off the _Minuet Step_ of _One_ and a _Fleuret_ upon 
the Ending of the sixth _Minuet Step_, instead of a seventh it makes 
the said Slip to the right Hand turning to each other from the con[-]
trary Sides of the Room, and the _Slip_ to the left Hand is instead of 
the eighth _Minuet Step_. 

This Step may also be performed with no small Advantage to 
the _Dance_, instead of the seventh and eighth _Minuet Steps_ of the 
fourth Division which are there obliquely; and the _Double Bouree_ 
forwards may be made upon the seventh _Minuet Step_ of the second 
or fifth Divsion[[опечатка]], concluding the eighth _Minuet Step_ in _One_ and a 
_Fleuret_ to the right Hand, as aforesaid, or instead of the fifth _Mi[-]
nuet Step_, after which theremaining are as described in the second 
Division or S. 

The third Way of this Step's Performance is by a half Turn upon 
the _Half Coupee_ or Beginning of the sixth _Minuet Step_ of _One_ and 
a _Fleuret_, opening off sideways to the right, or in the sixth Divisi[-]
on after the _Hop_ instead of the _Minuet Step_. 

The foregoing Graces or Steps being now united and brought in[-]
to the aforesaid _Dance_, and having their proper Places assigned 
therein, I shall conclude with one Observation more, _viz_. that it 
is in its Performance longer or shorter, according to the _Dancer_'s 
Pleasure. In Order to this instead of performing the second Di[-]
vision but once, as in the _Dance_ before described presenting the 
right Hand, it may be performed twice or thrice, only it must be 
noted that the fifth Division upon breaking off the left Hand is per[-]
formed the like Number of Times; that is to say if the second twice, 
the fifth the like, and if thrice the same after giving the single Hand; 
{141} but the shortest Way is once, as described in the foregoing _Dance_. 

The said _Dance_ and its Steps, as I have already observed, alto[-]
gether depend on Fancy, and are in their Performance various 
and uncertain; for it is left to the Pleasure of every one to perform 
them in the Order here set down, in any better Method of their 
own, or without any Steps. Indeed, it must be confessed that the 
Steps well performed in a _Minuet_ are great _Ornaments_ to that 
_Dance_, in filling it with Variety; yet at the same Time it must 
be owned the performing the plain _Minuet Steps_ alone is extreme[-]
ly graceful, if well accomplished, and in Effect the most _Gentle[-]
man-like_, or at least the faser[[опечатка]] of the two. 

### CHAP. XIII.

### _Of TIME or some Account of what TIME is, 
    with Rules to be observed in Keeping it._

TIME is a large Space or Distance without Variation or 
Change; and, as it has been from the Beginning of all things, 
it will remain 'till a Period be put thereto and it ceases to be. This 
mighty Space the great Author thereof, in his exceeding Wisdom, 
has divided or measured into equal Parts and Proportions, as Days 
into Hours, Months into Weeks, Quarters into Months, Years into 
Quarters, _&c_. which Divisions or Parts move or travel round in a 
continual but just and regular Motion or Pace, succeeding each 
other without ceasing until they arrive at the utmost Limits or 
Confines of _Time_, which will then be no more.

But leaving these sublime Thoughts to draw more closely to the 
Point or Subject in Hand, I shall endeavour to illustrate it by one 
Day or Measure of the foregoing _Space_ or _Time_, in supposing eve[-]
ry Hour therein to be Bars or Measures of a Dance or Tune; and 
that they are as short in Length or Time, as Measure in common or 
triple Time. I shall likewise shew, that by one Hour may be 
{142} comprehended the Scale both of common and triple Time: For 
Instance, the former thus.
 
COMMON TIME.

1 _Semibreve_. — 1 _Hour_.

2 _Minims_. — 2 _Half Hours_.

4 _Crotchets_ — 4 _Quarters of the Hour_.

8 _Quavers_ — 8 _Half Quarters of the Hour_.

16 _Semi-quavers_. — 16 _Half half Quarters of the Hour_.

The above is the whole _Proportion_ of _Common Time_ or of four 
to the Measure, as usually found in Books of _Music_; yet we often 
find in Pieces of _Music_ the sixteen _Semi-quavers_ doubled two and 
thirty Demi-semi-quavers, and then the Hour will be divided into 
the like Number of Parts. 

In Triple Time the Hour must be suppos'd to be divided into three 
Thirds or Parts, by Reason it only consists of three in a Bar or 
Measure: The Example is as follows.
 
TRIPLE TIME.

1 _Prick'd Minim_. — 1 _Hour in three Thirds_.

3 _Crotchets_. — 3 _Thirds or Parts of the Hour_.

6 _Quavers_. — 6 _Half Thirds or Parts of the Hour_.

12 _Semi-quavers_. — 12 _Half half Thirds or Parts of the Hour_. 

This is the _Proportion_ of _Triple Time_ or three in a Measure, as 
usually put down; yet sometimes it amounts to twenty four _Demi-
semi-quavers_ 

Having now shewn that the Hours of the _Day_ may be esteem'd 
as so many Measures of a _Tune_ or _Dance_, it must consequently be 
understood that a _Day_ of twelve Hours contains the like Number 
{143} of Measures; and, admitting that the _Tune_ or _Dance_ consisted of se[-]
venty two Bars, six Divisions or _Days_ would compleat it. This 
Comparison may possibly be thought by some foreign to the Purpose, 
tho' it is indeed very just and suitable; and I question not but up[-]
on farther Consideration it will appear so to the judicious Reader, for 
since the Subject in Hand is _Time_ and there is Nothing more cer[-]
tain than the _Day_ and its _Hours_, the latter will of Course imprint 
in the Mind stronger and juster Ideas of the former. 

However, it may perhaps be objected and at first View with great 
Show of Reason, that the _Time_ in _Dancing_ is various and liable to be 
changed to faster or slower, according to the Performer's Fancy; 
whereas the _Day_ and _Hours_ are immutable or without any Change. 
I answer, for this very Reason, as I have just observed it will give 
them a truer Notion of the Justness of _Time_, and be a Means to 
prevent their starting from or dragging behind it, which is often 
done by such whose Ears are pretty good, as well as by those who 
have very bad Ears, tho' it is the natural Fruit of the Want of an 
Ear which of all other Things is most difficult to cure, it being 
more a Gift of Nature than Art. This caused the _Ancients_ to 
say, the _Gods_ gave a _Genius_ to _Music_ and _Dancing_; and it is of that 
Importance in the latter as to render it impossible to please without 
Keeping _Time_, nor is it to be called _Dancing_ without it. 

From what has been said it appears, that to have a just and true 
Idea of _Time_ is of no small Consequence in order to _dance_ well, 
and that too much cannot be said upon this Head; which is, I 
think, a sufficient Motive for me to proceed in a few farther Ob[-]
servations upon it, which if duly consider'd, I am confident, will be 
found of remarkable Service. 

In the first Place then, you are to take Notice, that of the fore[-]
going _Proportions_ of _Time_ one is _common_ and the other _triple_, from 
whence arise all the Times and Movements made use of in _Dan[-]
cing_. From the former of these slow very slow _Entrees_ containing 
two Steps in each Measure call'd, _Quadruple_ or of two Times on 
Account of their Slowness or admitting of a suppos'd Bar in the Mid[-]
dle of the said Measure; but the rest as _Allemaignes_, _Gavots_, _Gal[-]
liards_, {144} _Bourees_, _Rigadoons_, _&c_. are only of one Time, as not al[-]
lowing of more than one Step to a Measure by Reason they are much 
lighter Movements than the aforesaid _Quadruple_, of which they 
are esteem'd but as half a Measure. The latter consists of _Louvres_, 
or slow _Jigs, Courants_, _Sarabands_, _Passacailles_, _Chaconnes_, _Minuets_, 
_Passepieds_, _&c_. the first of which namely _Louvres_ or slow _Jigs_ are 
of two Times or Steps to a Measure and agreeable with _Quadruple_, 
so that in Effect there are three Sorts of _Times_ in _Dancing_, _viz_. 
_common_, _triple_, and _quadruple_ proceeding from the two former; 
yet they are all reckon'd but as _common_ and _triple Time_ and only 
beat as such, except that some are slower and others quicker, which 
is the Subject I am now about to explain. 

_Common Time_, for, Instance, is of four Notes to the Bar or Mea[-]
sure, as has already been observed in the _Explanation_ of the Steps 
upon that _Time_; and the Rise or Beginning of the Step, in _Dan[-]
cing_, from a Sink always marks _Time_ to the _Tune_, as well as the 
fourth or last Note is in the Sink or Preparative for the Rise or beat[-]
ing Time to the succeeding Step, which no sooner is perform'd 
than the _Dancer_ proceeds to the next, as in _Walking_; and so on 
'till the Dance is compleated, keeping a just and equal Distance 
or Space between every Beginning and Ending of a Measure of the 
_Dance_, as has been observed by the _Hours_ of a _Day_, which is call'd 
_Time_, the same Way, as not making the Rise or marking of the 
_Time_, from a Sink upon the first Note which in all Measures is out 
of _Time_, and also performing the Steps of a _Dance_ sometimes fast[-]
er or slower than at others; but this is as morally impossible for 
one of a good Ear, as it wou'd[[опечатка]] be for a _well timed Watch_ to go out 
of _Time_. _Dancing_ may justly be consider'd as a _Watch_; for as, 
when the latter is set a going by the Springs, the Wheels move round 
measuring out the _Hours_ or Divisions of a _Day_ in certain and e[-]
qual Spaces, during the Time it goes: So the Springs and Steps of 
a _Dance_ ought to be continued after it is put in Motion by _Music_, 
'till the Whole is ended, which may easily be accomplish'd. But 
the Difficulty arises here; for Example, supposing a Person, would 
set his _Watch_ a going at Twelve at Noon, having no Rule nor any 
{145} Thing[[слово потеряно между страницами]] to direct him in it but beholding of the _Sun_, is it not a Thousand to 
One but he wou'd be either before or after the Time? The Case is the 
very same in _Dancing_, as to those who have not a _Genius_ or _Ear_ to 
_Music_; and tho' I durst engage to make such a One acquire the 
former, namely to _dance_ in just and regular _Time_, yet I wou'd not 
answer for his commencing upon the right Time by Reason, as I 
have observed in the Comparison of the _Sun_, it is a Point of a ve[-]
ry nice Nature and in Reality not to be done with any Certainty, 
if the _Ear_ is not first helped and improved by a Knowledge of that 
_Science_; no more than the former without a Skill in _Dialling_. 

Having by the going of a _Watch_ shewn the true and exact Time 
in which the Steps of a _Dance_ ought to be perform'd, and the Dif[-]
ficulty of suiting the Movement of the _Dance_ to that of the _Tune_, I 
shall proceed to give the Rules to be observed in beating or keeping 
Time to the foregoing Proportions of Time, which I take to be the 
first Step in the Affair under Consideration; and I shall begin with 
the _Gavot_, upon which Movement the _Time_ is sometimes beat directly 
upon the first of the four Notes belonging to the Measure, but most 
usually after letting pass or slip half a Measure, that is to say, the 
third and fourth Notes. For the better Understanding of this I shall 
name two or three _Dances_ of the latter Sort, _viz_. the _Princess Royal_ 
compos'd by Mr. _L'Abbee_, the _Princess Ann_ by Mr. _Siris_, and the 
_Gavot_ to the _Dance_, named the _Prince Eugene_, of my own Com[-]
position, and they all begin with odd Notes to which in the _Dance_ 
a plain Step or Walk is made, whilst the Person who beats _Time_ 
raises the Heel or Toe on playing the odd Notes of the _Tune_, in 
Order to strike full upon the _Time_ or first Note of the ensuing Mea[-]
sure; which is done in the Fall or Coming down of the Heel or 
Toe, either of which remains upon the Floor during the Counting 
of the first and second Notes or half Measure. While the third and 
fourth Notes, or concluding Half are counting the Heel or Toe is 
raised to mark Time to the succeeding Bar, as at first, and so on 
'till the whole _Tune_ or _Dance_ is ended, keeping an e[-]
xact and equal Motion up and down neither faster nor slower, and counting 
the said first, second, third, and fourth Notes successively over and 
{146} over during the same; so that the Heel or Toe rises upon the third 
Note, remains in the Air the fourth, comes down to the first, and 
rests the second, _&c_. as before. 

The _Galliard_ Movement is intirely the same, as to the beating 
Part, but not as to the odd Notes, for instead of two, as in the fore[-]
going, there is only one here; an Instance whereof we have in 
Mr. _Isaac_'s _Galliard_, upon which the Heel or Toe is raised to beat 
the Time upon the first Note, as aforesaid. These two Movements 
are rather more solemn and grave than the following, namely, 
_Allemaignes_, _Bourees_, _Rigadoons_, _&c_. but with Regard to the Me[-]
thod of beating _Time_ the very same, for they usually begin with 
an odd Note; and if not, 'tis only borrowing the last Note of the 
foregoing Measure for raising the Heel or Toe, as aforesaid. 

It is here to be noted, that it can never be reckoned out of _Time_, 
whether the said four Notes of the Measure be counted faster or 
slower, provided they are continued through the _Dance_, as begun 
at first; for tho' the Fancy of _Masters_ often differs upon this Point, 
yet every Movement has its proper _Time_. 

From what has been said it fully appears, that the first Note or 
Beginning of a Bar is the _Time_ or Mark the _Dancer_ must hit; and 
in Order thereto, as the Performer in _Music_, in playing of the _Tune_, 
prepares for beating _Time_ by taking up of the Toe or Heel, so does 
the _Dancer_ in making a Sink or Bending of the Knees to beat or 
mark _Time_ to the _Tune_, as well as to perform the first or introdu[-]
cing Step of the _Dance_; but whether it be done by a Rise upon the 
Toe, a Hop, or any other Step, it matters not, in that it is to be 
observed, the Rise from a Sink beats _Time_ in _Dancing_, as the Fall 
of the Heel does in _Music_.

Before I proceed to _triple Time_, it will be necessary to say some[-]
thing farther of _quadruple_, which from its Graveness is reckoned as 
two Times, as was already observed; and I know no more pro[-]
per or suitable Method of explaining it, since in Time and Value it is 
equivalent to two Measures of _common Time_, than the Counting e[-]
very Note double as One One, Two Two, Three Three, Four Four, 
and supposing them, what in Effect they really are, four _Minims_, for 
{147} in this Sort of _Time_ the _Crotchets_ are of equal Length to the _Minims_, 
and wou'd be as before observed, if the _Time_ was beat in the Mid[-]
dle of the Measure. For Instance, on the commencing of the third 
_Minim_ it is no longer _quadruple_ but _common Time_; from whence 
it follows, that the _Minims_ must be beat in their _Timing_, as one 
Measure, the same as the _Crotchets_, tho' in Length and Value double 
to them.

_Tunes of quadruple Time_ rarely, if ever, begin with odd Notes, 
as the foregoing _Tunes_ of _common_; and, for an Example, I shall 
name a _Tune_ or two of this Kind, as the _Entree d' Apolon_. But as 
that _Dance_ may not probably be known to such as this _Book_ is prin[-]
cipally design'd for, I shall name a second of the same Sort, name[-]
ly the _Godolphin_, compos'd by the late Mr. _Isaac_, upon which may 
be practised the _Time_ of this Movement; to which End the Heel is 
raised to mark the Time, as already explain'd, after which it remains 
on the Floor the playing of the first and second _Minims_ or half 
Measure. The third and fourth _Minims_ are in the two Motions 
the Heel or Toe makes in rising, in Order to mark the ensuing 
Measure: For Instance, the first Rise is made strong and brisk up[-]
on the Beginning of the latter half of the Measure or third Note; 
the second Rise is made farther up into the Air, in the same Manner 
as the first, to the fourth and last Note; upon the Expiration where[-]
of the Toe or Heel comes down marking the _Time_ to the next Bar, 
counting One One, Two Two, _&c_. as before, whilst the whole 
_Tune_ is compleated.

Having shewn how the _Dancer_ suits his Steps to the Notes of 
the _Music_, it will be of no Use to say any thing farther of that here; 
and therefore I shall only observe, that as there are in this Sort of 
_Tunes_ two Steps to each Measure, the first is beat, as usual, down, 
but the second is marked up in the Air, on the Beginning of the 
third _Minim_, as above explained. 

Being now arrived at _triple Time_ or of three in a Measure, I have 
little to say, having already in the foregoing Proportions of _Time_ 
described the Manner of beating or marking _Time_; for it is altoge[-]
ther superfluous and unnecessary to enlarge, since it is intirely in 
{148} the same Method, except to make a few Observations touching the 
most material Difference in the Movements thereof; and first observe, 
that the _Courante_ is a Sort of _quadruple_ Movement which consists of 
three _Minims_, instead of the like Number of _Crotchets_, as in the 
rest following; which Minims are usually divided into double the 
Quantity of _prick'd Crotches_ and _Quavers_, mix'd or blended pro[-]
miscuously together, according to the _Composer_'s Fancy, produ[-]
cing this Movement and play'd as three _Minims_, which renders it 
very solemn and grave; and, in its counting or beating in Time 
it is the same as the foregoing _quadruple_, only it is a _Minim_ less and 
generally begins with an odd _Quaver_ or half Note. Upon this the 
Heel or Toe is raised, as aforesaid, to mark the _Time_ of first Note 
in the Coming down of the Toe or Heel, counting One One, Two 
Two, during which, two Thirds of the Measure the Foot rests upon 
the Ground. In the third and remaining _Minim_ or Part the 
Heel or Toe is raised in Readiness to mark the Measure following, 
which is perform'd successively on, in like Manner, keeping just and 
regular _Time, &c_. as was shewn before; but, for an Example, I 
shall name the _La Burgogne_ by Mr. _Pecour_ and _Brawl_ of _Audenarde_ 
by Mr. _Siris_. 

The next grave Movements are _Sarabands_, _Passacailles_, and _Cha[-]
connes_, each of three _Crotchets_ to a Measure, and every one a De[-]
gree lighter than the other: Nevertheless the Method of beating _Time_ 
is the same as described above in the _Courante_ Movement, only in[-]
stead of _Minims_ to _Crotchets_ and of the _Time_'s commencing after an 
odd Note, it is mark'd directly as in _quadruple_; that is to say, ex[-]
cepting _Chaconnes_, which always begin with odd Notes. Exam[-]
ples of the two former Sorts are the _Princess Ann_, the _Follie D'Es[-]
paigne_, and _Passacaille D'armid_, all which _Dances_ were compos'd 
by Mr. _L'Abbee_; and also of the latter the _Princess Ann's Chaconne_ by 
the same Author is an Instance, where a whole Measure is let slip 
before the Time commences. 

The next _Minuets_ and _Passepieds_ are still brisker, the first being 
of three _Crotchets_ to a Bar or Measure, and the second of three 
_Quavers_; and the first usually begins without odd Notes, but the se[-]
cond {149} never. The _Time_ of these Movements, in _Dancing_, ought never 
to be beat after every Bar but every other Measure, by Reason, as 
has been said, one _Minuet Step_ takes two Measures of these Move[-]
ments; and it is to be noted that, as in _quadruple_, the Time is to 
be mark'd the first Measure down, and second up, instead of twice 
down. It must be farther observed that if the Strains of the _Minu[-]
et_ or _Passepied_ consist of eight, as they most frequently do, four 
_Minuet Steps_ are equivalent to a Strain once over; from whence it 
follows, that the Beginning of a Strain, whether the first or second 
it matters not, is always the _Time_ the _Dancer_ is to mark or hit, and 
from thence to proceed on from one second Bar to another upon 
the _Time_, neither varying to faster nor slower, than at first setting 
out, during the Performance of the whole _Dance_; and if the _Minu[-]
et_ or _Passepied_ is of more Measures, it is nevertheless performed 
in the same Manner. There is Plenty of Examples of the former 
Kind, as is of the latter the _Royal George_, that is, the Conclusion 
and Beginning of the _Bretagne_; the first by Mr. _L'Abbee_, the 
second by Mr. _Pecour_, to which I shall add one more of my own 
Composition, namely, the _Passepied Round_. 

As to _Tunes_ of _triple Time_ agreeing with _quadruple_, _viz_. _Lou[-]
vres_ or slow Jigs, they are of two Measures, or of six _Crotchets_ in 
the Bar, the first three whereof are beat down and the remaining 
up, each answering to a Measure of a _Saraband_, and a Movement 
usually beginning in odd Notes. For Instance, the _Entree Espagnol_ 
and _Pastoral Dance_, the latter by the late Mr. _Isaac_; and the _Union_ 
by the same Author is of this Nature, tho' it does not begin with 
odd Notes as the _Dances_ aforesaid. As the foregoing Discourse 
shews that _Louvres_ or slow _Jigs_ are agreeable to _quadruple Time_, I 
shall next proceed to observe, that _Jigs_ and airy light _Tunes_ of the 
like Number of Notes to the Measures, as the aforesaid, agree with 
_Rigadoons_ in _common Time_, and beat as such in marking the first 
three down, and the remaining up; as for Example, in _Jigs_ or _For[-]
lanes_, the _Princess Amelia_ compos'd by Mr. _L'Abbee_, and the _Dance_ 
of that Movement by Mr. _Pecour_; and the _Shepherdess_ compos'd 
by my self is likewise an Example of this Sort. 

{150} There is yet another Movement that occurs to my Memory, 
namely, the _Canary_, which is of a very brisk Nature, consisting on[-]
ly of three or six _Quavers_ in a Measure, but usually the latter, 
slipping before the _Time_ is beat three _Quavers_ or half a Measure, 
and marking the three first down and the rest up; and the last 
Movement of the _Royal Galliard_ by the late Mr. _Isaac_ is an 
Example of this Kind. 

There is still a Movement unobserved, of the like Quantity of 
Notes to a Measure, _viz_. the _Hornpipe_, which is of three _Minims_ 
or six _Crotchets_ in the Bar, and, in marking or beating _Time_, agrees 
with a _Tune of triple Time_ or of three, as for Instance a _Saraband_, 
in which the Foot remains down, during the counting of One, Two, 
and upon the third rises to mark the ensuing Measure _&c_. The se[-]
cond Parts of the _Union_ and _Richmon_d are both _Dances_ of a _Horn[-]
pipe_ Movement, and of the late Mr _Isaac_'s Composition. 

Besides the foregoing Rules of beating _Time_ it may be of Service 
to such as have but _indifferent Ears_, when they are about to _dance_ 
in any Assembly or private Room, or in their _Dancing_, to _hearken_ 
to the _Tune_, that they may know the _Time_ in which the _Dance_ 
is to be perform'd; which they may more easily do by Reason the 
_Music_ rarely fail of beating _Time_ to the _Tune_ they are playing, or 
at least ought not, because hearing the beating or striking of the 
Toe or Heel against the Floor are visible and certain Marks of the 
_Dancers_ commencing. 

Moreover in _Dancing_, if the _Partner_ with whom we _dance_ be a 
good Performer, we should take Care to keep our Steps and Figure 
agreeable with theirs; and I am of Opinion, if a Person has the least 
Notion of the Steps he is performing, it will be very easy for him to 
observe, whether they begin and end together, which I believe may 
be useful in _Dancing_. 

However, as I have said before, the most sure Method I take to 
be, _listening_ to the _Music_ and _Time_ beat thereto, tho 'that itself is 
uncertain, nothing being more common than the _hearing_ of a 
_Tune_ begun in one _Time_, and, before it is ended, to be near as fast 
again; which renders it impossible for the best _Dancers_ whatsoever 
{151} to _dance_ as they ought, for instead of their finding the Note upon 
which they should step, it is push'd or drove from under their Feet 
during every Step they take, and of Consequence causes them to 
lose that natural and careless Air so agreeable in _Dancing_, notwith[-]
standing they keep up with the _Tune_, as being never certain of its 
_Time_. Indeed, it must be own'd to be the _Dancer_'s Business to _dance_ 
to the _Tune_; yet it is nevertheless the _Music_'s Part to beat and keep 
constant and true _Time_, as well at the latter Part of a _Tune_ as at 
first. By this Means the _Dancers_, sure of the _Time_ they _dance_ to, 
perform not only with Pleasure and Ease to themselves, but also give a 
double Satisfaction to the _Spectators_ in beholding the _Dancers_; for 
altho' the latter are at a considerable Distance from each other, yet 
the former will observe, that every Movement or Sink and Rise the 
_Dancers_ make is exactly the same in one as well as the other; 
the former in Order to mark _Time_, and the latter in marking of it. 
Moreover every Turn, Step, Spring or Bound seen in one will be 
at the same Instant observed in the other, in such an exact Symme[-]
try and Harmony of the Parts agreeing with the Notes of the _Mu[-]
sic_, as to cause the most agreeable Surprize in the Beholders of the 
two _Dancers_; or admitting a Dozen or more in Number, by ob[-]
serving them all to move as only one Person. This is the natu[-]
ral Effect of good _Dancing_ adorn'd with all its Beauties, in that the 
_Music_ seems to inspire the _Dancing_, and the latter the former; and 
the Concurrence of both is so requisite to charm those who _behold_ 
them, that each of them in some Measure suffers by a Separation. 
For Example the _Eye_ can receive no Pleasure in the _Music_ any 
more than the _Ear_ in _Dancing_; but in Conjunction there is at once 
an Attack upon both these Senses. 

Tho' this is only an imperfect Draught of _fine Dancing_, yet it 
may serve to shew how frequently this Art suffers by the _Unskilful[-]
ness_ of its _Performers_, whether it arise from the Want of a true 
Knowledge of the Steps, a bad Ear, or from any other Cause; and 
this it was that gave Birth to my Treatise on _Dancing_, in which the 
principal and most remarkable Steps in that _Art_ are described and 
taken in Pieces. I have also shewn how the Step sof[[опечатка Steps of]] each Measure 
{152} are made to _common_ or _triple Time_; and in the _Minuet_ I have given 
an Explanation of all the Steps of that _Dance_; and shewn, tho' in 
Effect it is not so, how it may be reduced into a regular _Dance_. 
In discoursing upon Time, I have given Examples in the most known 
_Tunes_ of every Movement, upon which it may be practised or beat[-]
en; and in the Rules for the same I have fully made appear, how 
the Steps of the foregoing Discourse, altho' in Pieces, are there uni[-]
ted and set together again, moving in just _Time_ to the Sound of _Mu[-]
sic_, as the _Watch_ is put in Motion by its Springs. Upon taking 
some farther Notice of the Elevation, Movement, and graceful Fall 
of the _Arms_, together with some Observations concerning _Country 
Dancing_, I shall conclude this Work, in Hopes that, as the 
chief, nay only Motive of undertaking it was the _Publick Good_, 
it may answer the desired End; the accomplishing whereof will be 
a sufficient Recompence for the great Pains, Trouble, and Expence 
I have been at in compleating the same; and, as there never hither[-]
to appeared in the World, at least in our Language, a Piece of this 
Nature, I flatter my self it will meet with the more Acceptance. 

### CHAP. XIV.

### _Of the Movement of the ARMS in DANCING._

HAVING shewn the Method in which the different Steps are 
to be taken and perform'd, I shall now proceed to shew how 
the Movements of the _Arms_ ought to accompany the said Steps in 
_Dancing_; left this Work should be compared to the Legs and Bo[-]
dy of a Man without _Arms_. 

However as on the one Hand, I shall make it my Study to omit 
Nothing that can contribute to compleat this _Work_, I shall at the 
same Time, on the other, only observe what I apprehend to be ma[-]
terial, {153} without tiring the _Reader_'s Patience on a Subject which can[-]
not be compleated without the very best _Masters_. The Correspon[-]
dence of the _Legs_ and _Arms_ in _Dancing_ is a Point of so nice a Na[-]
ture that any Awkwardness or improper Movements therein would 
destroy the Beauty of the whole, since that _Dancing_ cannot be good 
which is decrepid or lame in any of its Parts, any more than a _Gentle[-]
man_ or _Lady_ can be justly esteem'd compleatly genteel who are 
naturally and easily disposed in some Parts and disagreeable in o[-]
thers; so that in fine it is the very Polish and finishing Stroke.

For the better comprehending of this we must first take Notice 
that, in whatsoever Position we stand before the Elevation or Rai[-]
sing of the _Arms_, the Palms or Insides of the Hands are to our Side 
in a genteel easy Shape or Fashion, the whole _Arms_ hanging from un[-]
der the Shoulders without Force downwards, or too much Relaxati[-]
on upwards, but natural and easy in a Readiness for the Elevation[[See the Figures in Plate I, B. I]]. 

The next Observation relates to the Position of the Hands after 
their Elevation or being raised; and we should find them with the 
Palms of the Hands to the Presence or right forwards with the Arms 
both open or extended, in the like Manner we have described them 
by the Sides, neither too much raised nor too much sunk beneath 
the Shoulders, but graceful and easy, and being so disposed ready 
to perform the first Motion, which in the Movement of the _Arms_ 
above corresponds with the Sink or Bending of the Knees below[[See Plates II and XV in B. I]]. 
This is done by moving or raising the whole _Arms_; and, in the 
Fall of the said _Arms_ to their first Situation after their Elevation, 
the Palms of the Hands, instead of right forwards as before, are 
now to the Floor; which is effected by a slow and easy Turning of 
the said Wrists during the Motion of the said _Arms_ downwards 
compleating the Movement or Motion of the _Arms_, from whence 
all other Movements take their Rise or Beginning; so that, if the 
graceful Raising or Elevation of the _Arms_ from the Sides to the 
Palms right forwards be by a slow and even Raising of the Wrists, 
turning outwards or backwards 'till they arrive at their proper 
Height as before described[[See Plates II and XV in B. I]], their becoming Fall must in like 
{154} Manner[[See the Plates XV, and II, B. I]] be in the Turn of the Wrists and Palms of the Hands 
downwards in a slow and even Motion inwards, or forwards, 
whilst the Palms are to the Sides, as at first[[See the Figures in Plate I, B. I]], greatly resembling 
the Fall of a Feather or the Coming down of a Bird, their Fall is so 
smooth and easy; and it is a wonderful Grace to _Dancing_ when 
well performed. 

To avoid being tedious or overloading this Subject with too ma[-]
ny Observations I shall reduce the various Movements of the _Arms_ 
to three or four, _viz_. first, the Movement of the Wrists from the 
_Elbows_ round upwards[[See Plate XV, B. I]]. Secondly, the _Movement_ of the _Arms_ 
inwards in their Motion upwards[[See Plate X, B. I]]. Thirdly, the compleating 
the said _Movement_ of the _Arms_ inwards by the _Movement_ of the 
_Wrists_ round upwards mentioned before[[See Plate XV, B. I]]. And fourthly, the ir[-]
regular or _contrary Movement_[[See Plates IV, V, VI, IX, XII, XIII, XIV. B. I]]. 

Now, as to the Method of Performance and Timing of the _Move[-]
ment_ of the _Wrists_ round upwards, it is by a slow and even Motion 
or Movement of the _Knuckles_ or _Forefingers_ and _Thumbs_ upwards 
round from a small Bend of the _Wrists_ and _Elbows_ corresponding 
therewith[[See Plate X, B. I]]. The Commencing is upon one, the _Movement_ 
round backwards[[See Plate X, B. I]] finishing in a Flirt or careless Motion of the 
_Wrists_ and _Arms_ in their Return to their former Situation, as in 
the Position of the _Arms_ after their Elevation; upon two[[See Plate XV, B. I]] and 
three if to triple Time, in the Motion or Preparative for the _Move[-]
ment_ of the _Arms_ next ensuing, as it will conclude in like Manner 
upon four, if to _common_ Time. 

The next _Movement_ is made by the easy Fall of the _Elbows_ at 
the same Time or Instant; and the _Knuckles_ or _Forefingers_ and 
_Thumbs_ lead the Way in a smooth and easy Motion from below up[-]
wards forming a quarter or half Circle or Bow[[See the Figures in Plates X, and XI, B. I]]. The _Hands_ in a 
handsome Fashion may be supposed the Ends or Points of the said half 
Circle or Bow; and it is to be noted that this Movement is on[-]
ly {155} about the one Half of the aforesaid. But as that begun by form[-]
ing the Circle round upwards above the Position of the _Arms_, the 
_Elbows_ during the _Movement_ of the _Wrists_ remaining elevated un[-]
til the Flirt or Finishing is made, on the other Hand in this 
_Movement_ of the _Arms_ the half Circle, or Motion the _Wrists_ 
make, is below the Position of the _Arms_; and, instead of the _Elbows_ 
remaining elevated, as before, together with the whole _Arms_, they 
fall or sink down in a slow, smooth, and easy Motion, whilst the _Fore[-]
fingers_ and _Thumbs_, as aforesaid, at the same Time move up[-]
wards in the like slow and deliberate Manner, finishing together 
with the _Hands_ above and the _Elbows_ below in Order to the throw[-]
ing the Arms open off again, as in _Hops, Chassees_, and the like, 
for which these are the proper _Arms_. The bringing them in on 
the Conclusion of the foregoing Step, as just described [[See the Figures in Plates X and XI, B. I]], is in Order 
to the said throwing them out on the Time or Beginning of the 
next Step[[See Plate XV, B. I]] for which this is the Preparative, tho' the _Movement_ of the 
_Arms_ to the Palms of the _Hands_ downwards must always be first 
made by Way of farther Preparation, concluding open and exten[-]
ded, 'till the Measure is expired; and from hence it appears, that 
these two Movements usually answer each separately to a Measure 
or Step, forming together much about a whole Circle. The for[-]
mer Half, as I have said, moves under the Position of the _Arms_, and 
the latter Half above in the _Movement_ of the _Arms_ round upwards 
in the Form and Manner above described; and these are the se[-]
cond and third _Movements_ I proposed to explain. 

The _irregular_ or _fourth_ and _last Movement_ is produced from the 
two former, _viz_, by the Fall of the _Elbow_ of one _Hand_ as the 
Knuckle moves upwards, whilst the other at the same Time per[-]
forms the Motion of the _Arm_ round upwards; which compose a 
fine _Contrast_, concluding both at the same Time[[See Plates IV, V, VI, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, B. I]] with one 
Hand bended and the other extended[[See Plates IV, V, VI, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, B. I]]. This beautiful _contrast[-]
ed_ Movement changes, every Step alternately, first one Hand and 
then the other, and is the proper _Movement_ of the _Arms_ in _Half_ 
{156} _Coupees_, _Marches_, _Bourees_, and the like; only it must be obser[-]
ved that the bended _Arm_ is the contrary _Arm_ to the beginning 
_Foot_ in any of the Steps[[See Plates IV, VI, IX, XII, XIV, B. I]] aforesaid, excepting backwards or side[-]
ways, because then the _Opposition_ or _Contrast_ is between the same 
_Hand_ and _Foot_, as was already shewn in treating of _Walking_[[See Plate XIII, B. I]]. 
The _Movement_ of the _Arms_ round upwards[[See Plate XV, B. I]] is made use of in 
_Pirouttes_, _Bourees_ with a _Bound_, and all such like Steps. 

Altho' there are various other Methods or Manners of _moving_ the 
_Arms_ in _Dancing_, yet as these, like the five _Positions_ with Regard 
to the _Feet_, are as it were the principal, it is needless (nor indeed is 
it agreeable to my present Design) to enlarge, especially on a Sub[-]
ject which, as I have already said, cannot be sufficiently described by 
_Words_ but must be compleated by the very best _Masters_; and there[-]
fore to avoid Trifling, as I have described and given some Hints of the 
Method or Manner of _moving_ the _Arms_ which will agree with 
all the Steps made Use of in genteel _Dancing_, I shall refer the rest 
to the personal Instructions of a _Master_ properly qualified, who 
must compleat what is here wanting, not only in Relation to the 
_Movements_ of the _Arms_ but also those of the Feet between 
which there is, as I have already observed, a perfect Connexion 
and Harmony. The _Fingers_ and _Toes_, _Wrists_ and _Ancles_, _El[-]
bows_ and _Knees_, _Shoulders_ and _Hips_, in _Dancing_ must move all of 
a Piece; and in fine the Compleating of this is the End I had 
chiefly in View in composing this _Work_.

### CHAP. XV.

### _Of COUNTRY DANCING._ 

THO' my original Design was only to have spoke of genteel 
_Dancing_, yet as _Country Dances_ are at all _Assemblies_ or _Balls_ 
introduced as it were a Part of or belonging to the former, (and 
{157} indeed I think it may very properly be esteem'd as a luxuriant or 
careless Branch growing out from the other) and is become as it were 
the Darling or favourite Diversion of all Ranks of People from the 
Court to the Cottage in their different Manners of _Dancing_, and as 
the Beauty of this agreeable Exercise (I mean when perform'd in the 
_genteel Character_) is very much eclipsed and destroyed by certain 
_Faults_, or _Omissions_, in the _Performers_ not hitherto, if I remem[-]
ber right, taken Notice of in any _Books_; I shall, at the Request of 
some Persons of Figure my Subscribers, endeavour to point out 
those _Neglects_ which render this Diversion, to fine _Dancers_, either 
altogether disagreeable, or much less pleasant, because one or two 
Couples either through _Carelesness_, or _Want of better Instructions_, 
will put the whole Set in Disorder.

This will always be occasioned by the _Couples_ below those who 
lead up the _Dance_, when they omit moving up into the first _Couple_'s 
Places, on their casting off, and down again in their casting up to 
their Places as at first; or the like, if the first or leading _Couples_ 
cross over and figure in. In a Word, whenever the leading _Cou[-]
ple_ move downwards, the _Couples_ coming up to lead the _Dance_ 
should move upwards and, when they move up again, the _Cou[-]
ples_ who do not lead the _Dance_ ought to move down again, 
attending the Motion of the _Dancers_ going down with the _Dance_, 
who in Return will attend them in like Manner, when they ar[-]
rive at the upper End to _dance_ in their Turns. The nice Obser[-]
vation of this presents to the _Beholders_ an agreeable Prospect of the 
whole Company in Motion at once, instead of the Confusion that 
happens when this is neglected; as when in giving the right Hand 
and left in going round downwards from above, or upwards from 
below, instead of continuing on and giving first the right and then 
the left Hand to those you meet, you turn back, or if in Conver[-]
sation with your _Partner_, or otherwise, you be not attentive and 
ready to begin at the Conclusion of any Part or Division of the 
_Dance_; which frequently falls out for, when the coming up _Couples_ 
have concluded the _Dance_ with those going down, they often for[-]
get that they are immediately to begin again with the next above 
{158} them, and so for _Want_ of _Attention_ breed Confusion and at the 
same Time expose themselves to the _Spectators_.

Indeed good Breeding, in Regard to those with whom we _dance_, 
requires our not being _careless_; and yet my _fair Readers_ and _o[-]
thers_ I hope will excuse me, if I tell them I fear this is too often the 
Case, since with due Circumspection and Care it is impossible not 
to follow almost any _Country Dance_, tho' I must own when I was 
a _Youth_ I thought it Conjuration. If we place ourselves at the 
Bottom, and, instead of Talking, take a Survey of the _Dance_, 
whatever it is in its Performance, over and over again, first with one 
_Couple_ and then with another, it is impossible, I say, but we must 
be able to go down with it, when it comes to our Turns, as well 
as avoid Disorders in our gradual Ascent to the upper End; it be[-]
ing only to observe and distinguish one from another the Things of 
of which the different Parts of all _Dances_ whatsoever are composed 
whether _Casting off_ or _up_, _Figuring in_, _Hands across_ or _round_, 
_Right Hand and Left_, _Flying_, _Pursuing_, _Clapping of Hands_, _Heys_, 
_Leading up_ or _down_, _Back to Back_, _Changing of Places_, _Falling 
back_, _Meeting again_, or whatever it be, by dividing one Part of 
the above Catalogue from the other. And with a little Practice 
you will soon be able not only to follow _Country Dances_ but also 
lead them up, tho' you never _danced_ them before: For Instance, 
if a _Gentleman_ or _Lady_ at the upper End propose a _Dance_ to their 
_Partner_ unknown to one of them, you need only ask how it be[-]
gins, and they will acquaint you, and whether it be _Falling Back_, 
_Meeting again_, _Crossing over_, or whatsoever else, you will readily 
perform it. For this Reason I would advise all _young People_ and 
_others_ who are not perfect in _Right Hand_ and _left_, _Figuring in_, 
_Heys_, and the like, before they attempt to _dance_ in Public, to 
make themselves well acquainted with and able to perform all the 
different Parts or Divisions of _Country Dancing_; which they may 
privately learn amongst one another, if they don't care to practise 
in Public, and thereby not only render this Diversion more agree[-]
able to themselves, but also more pleasing to those who accompany 
them in this Exercise. 

{159} Besides as I have before hinted, instead of giving a confused Idea 
to the _Beholders_ it will afford an agreeable Landscape or Prospect of 
so many Pairs of fine _Gentlemen_ and _Ladies_ gracefully in Motion 
to the Sound of _Music_, and compleating each Part of the _Dance_ in 
_Time_ to the Measure, or Strains of the _Tune_, as it were of one Ac[-]
cord: As of even Rows longwise when falling back and meeting 
again; half Circles, when casting off or up again; Figures of Eight 
or Binding of a Hedge, as in Figuring in, or the Heys; irregular 
Figures, whenone flies and the other pursues; round Circles, 
when Hands are joined; cross Figures, when the right or left 
Hands are joined moving round; Beating Time in Contrast, as when 
Hands are clapped first in Time with their own, and next crosswise 
with their right Hand against their _Partner_'s, or others again clap 
their own Hands, and afterwards strike the left in Contrast; Lead[-]
ing crosswise in Rows, in Order of marching up the Room and the 
like down, with various other beautiful Circles and Figures. If a 
fine Picture, beautiful Fields, crystal Streams, green Trees, and im[-]
broider'd Meadows in Landscape or Nature itself will afford such de[-]
lightful Prospects, how much more must so many well shap'd 
_Gentlemen_ and _Ladies, richly dress'd, in the exact Performance of 
this Exercise, please the _Beholders_, who entertain them with such 
a Variety of living Prospects. 

Having in the above Sketch or Draught attempted to raise some 
noble Ideas of _Country Dancing_, when performed in a proper Man[-]
ner, and in the foregoing _Instructions_ pointed out and removed 
all the most material _Faults_ and _Omissions_ in the Performance 
of this Branch of our _Art_, which either obstruct the Pleasure of 
the _Dancers_, or _Beholders_, I think I have finished what I designed, 
_viz_. the Improvement and Pleasure of others. I shall therefore 
conclude this _Work_, not in the least questioning but my good Inten[-]
tions will meet with a favourable Reception from the Public, es[-]
pecially from those who receive Benefit or Profit thereby.
